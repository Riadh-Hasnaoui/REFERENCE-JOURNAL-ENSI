\#\# Abstract

\`\`\`  
Code localization–identifying precisely where  
in a codebase changes need to be made–is  
a fundamental yet challenging task in soft-  
ware maintenance. Existing approaches strug-  
gle to efficiently navigate complex codebases  
when identifying relevant code snippets. The  
challenge lies in bridging natural language  
problem descriptions with the target code el-  
ements, often requiring reasoning across hier-  
archical structures and multiple dependencies.  
We introduceLOCAGENT, a framework that  
addresses code localization through a graph-  
guided agent. By parsing codebases into di-  
rected heterogeneous graphs,LOCAGENTcre-  
ates a lightweight representation that captures  
code structures and their dependencies, en-  
abling LLM agents to effectively search and  
locate relevant entities through powerful multi-  
hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-  
world benchmarks demonstrate that our ap-  
proach significantly enhances accuracy in code  
localization. Notably, our method with the  
fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B  
model achieves comparable results to SOTA  
proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (ap-  
proximately 86% reduction), reaching up to  
92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while  
improving downstream GitHub issue resolu-  
tion success rates by 12% for multiple attempts  
(Pass@10). Our code is available athttps:

\#\# 1 Introduction

\`\`\`  
Code localization can be viewed as an information  
retrieval (IR) task that aims to identify relevant  
code snippets given natural language descriptions  
(Suresh et al., 2024). Accurate code localization is  
crucial for software maintenance and evolution, as  
it identifies the precise locations for code modifi-  
cations such as bug fixes, refactoring, and feature

Figure 1: Code localization across four common pro-

description, the goal of code localization is to identify  
the relevant code snippets that require modification to  
resolve the issue.

additions (Figure 1), thus streamlining the devel-  
opment workflow (Wang et al., 2024b). This ca-  
pability has become fundamental for powerful AI  
assistants (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2023), code-  
aware search engines (PerplexityAI, 2023), and au-  
tomated programming agents (Cognition.ai, 2024;  
Wang et al., 2025). However, understanding code  
for localization consumes up to 66% of developers’  
debugging time (Böhme et al., 2017), and remains  
difficult for automated tools (Kang et al., 2024; Qin  
et al., 2024). Unlike traditional retrieval tasks that  
primarily focus on lexical or semantic matching  
between queries and documents (Guo et al., 2016,  
2020), code localization presents unique challenges.  
Specifically, it requires bridging the gap between  
natural language and programming languages, un-  
derstanding structural and semantic properties of  
the codebase, and performing multi-step reasoning  
to analyze the issue (Xia et al., 2024; Zhang et al.,  
2024b).  
Existing approaches to code localization face sig-  
nificant limitations. Dense retrieval methods (Wang  
et al., 2023b; Günther et al., 2023\) require main-  
taining and continuously updating vector represen-

tations of the entire codebase, creating engineering  
challenges for large and fast-evolving repositories.  
While LLMs demonstrate strong code understand-  
ing abilities (Kang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023),  
models with large context windows still cannot pro-  
cess entire codebases at once, necessitating strate-  
gic navigation. Moreover, issue descriptions of-  
ten mention only symptoms rather than underlying  
causes. For instance, a report of ‘XSS vulnera-  
bility in user profile’ might require changes to a  
shared validation utility in the codebase, which do  
not explicitly mentioned in the issue. This discon-  
nect between issue descriptions and affected code  
blocks presents a substantial challenge for tradi-  
tional retrieval approaches, which struggle to trace  
implicit dependencies across the codebase. Recent  
agent-based methods attempt to address these lim-  
itations through iterative exploration (Yang et al.,  
2024; Wang et al., 2025). However, they still strug-  
gle to efficiently navigate and comprehend com-  
plex code structures and dependencies, particularly  
when multi-hop reasoning is required to trace from  
issue descriptions to affected code regions.  
This raises a key question:How can we design  
efficient, structure-aware indexing as intermedi-  
ate representations that are both easy and perfor-  
mant for LLM agents to consume?It is intuitive  
to design an agentic retrieval system that carefully  
combines traditional IR methods and LLM agent’s  
reasoning ability to achieve accurate, efficient and  
cost-effective code localization in codebases.  
To address this challenge, we proposeLOCA-  
GENT, a framework that builds directed het-  
erogeneous graph indexing to unify code struc-  
tures, dependencies, and contents. The index-  
ing process typically takes only a few seconds  
per codebase, making it highly practical for real-  
time use. Our lightweight graph representa-  
tion, coupled with sparse indexing techniques,  
enables efficient entity search while maintain-  
ing rich structural information. Moreover, the  
framework integrates a set of unified tools that  
empower the agent with efficient exploration ca-  
pabilities and autonomous navigation based on

\`\`\`  
contextual needs. Furthermore, by fine-tuning  
Qwen-2.5-Coder- Instruct(Hui et al., 2024\)  
7B and 32B models (abbreviated asQwen-2.5-7B  
andQwen-2.5-32Brespectively), our framework  
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-  
art models like Claude-3-5-sonnet-  
(Claude-3.5) (Anthropic, 2023\) while signifi-  
cantly reducing API costs by over 80% (from $0.  
to $0.09 per example), making it practical for real-  
world deployment.  
Additionally, to facilitate a comprehensive eval-  
uation of code localization methods, we intro-  
duce LOC-BENCH, a new benchmark specifi-  
cally designed for this task. Existing benchmarks  
like SWE-Bench(Jimenez et al., 2023\) present  
significant limitations: (1) they risk contamina-  
tion through data overlap with LLM training sets  
(Mündler et al., 2024), and (2) they primarily fo-  
cus on bug fixing, lacking diversity in maintenance  
scenarios such as feature requests, performance  
optimizations, and security fixes. In contrast,LOC-  
BENCHcovers diverse scenarios and mitigates po-  
tential contamination concerns by incorporating  
more examples from popular Python repositories  
collected after known LLMs’ training cutoff dates.

2.1 Traditional Retrieval-based Methods  
Traditional IR methods rely on lexical or semantic  
matching to return ranked lists of code snippets.  
Sparse retrievers, such as BM25 (Robertson et al.,  
1994), have demonstrated robustness to domain  
adaptation. Dense retrievers utilize embeddings  
for improved semantic searching, including models  
with open checkpoints such as general text embed-  
ding models E5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022\) and  
proprietary APIs (VoyageAI, 2024). Code embed-  
ding models such as Jina-Code-v2 (Günther et al.,  
2023), Codesage-large-v2 (Zhang et al., 2024a),  
and CodeRankEmbed (Suresh et al., 2024), trained  
specifically for code related tasks, showing signif-  
icant performance in Code2Code and NL2Code  
semantic search tasks.

Figure 2: Overview ofLOCAGENTframework.LOCAGENTfirst parses the given codebase to build a graph-based  
code representation with various entity and relation types. It then constructs sparse indexes for structure exploration  
and content search. Using these indexes, it performs agent-guided searches that combine the graph and tools.  
\`\`\`  
2.2 LLM-based Generative Retrieval  
Recently, LLMs with advanced code reasoning ca-  
pabilities have demonstrated superior performance  
by directly processing queries and raw code for  
code localization (Kang et al., 2023; Wu et al.,  
2023; Xia et al., 2024). For example, Agent-  
less (Xia et al., 2024), initially designed for au-  
tomated program repair, uses a simplistic hierar-  
chical localization process powered by LLM. It  
employs a straightforward three-phase approach  
that localizes relevant code sections before attempt-  
ing to fix the given issues. Expanding on these  
techniques, agent-based methods utilize multi-step  
reasoning to enable automated codebase traversal.  
Specifically, OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025\) imple-  
ments a generalist coding agent that supports bash  
commands likegrepand tools for viewing files.  
SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024\) integrates a cus-  
tom Agent-Computer Interface to support agents  
to navigate entire repositories. MoatlessTools (Ör-  
wall, 2024\) combines an agentic searching loop  
and semantic search to obtain code locations.

\`\`\`  
2.3 Graph-based Code Representation  
Due to the inherent structure of code, several works  
have employed graph-based representations to im-  
prove code understanding by capturing key rela-  
tionships between components. Aider (2023) con-  
structs a RepoMap and uses a graph ranking algo-  
rithm to identify the most significant contextual ele-  
ments. Similarly, as a plugin, RepoGraph (Ouyang  
et al., 2025\) performs subgraph retrieval–extracting  
ego-graphs with the search term in the centric–to  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
provide structured context. CodexGraph (Liu et al.,  
2024\) indexes the repository into a Neo4j graph  
database, where LLM agents query the database  
precisely using Cypher. These methods focus pri-  
marily on providing relevant context. In addition,  
RepoUnderstander (Ma et al., 2024\) builds hierar-  
chical and function-call graphs, using Monte Carlo  
Tree Search (MCTS) based repository exploration  
strategy to empower agents the ability of collecting  
repository-level knowledge. OrcaLoca (Yu et al.,  
2025\) uses a simplified graph enhanced by priority  
scheduling and context pruning, which maintains  
efficient search. These methods build and utilize  
the code graph in various ways (Table 1).

\#\# 3 The LOCAGENTFramework

\`\`\`  
We introduceLOCAGENT, a graph-guided LLM  
agent framework for code localization. Figure 2 il-  
lustrates the overall framework. Given a codebase,  
LOCAGENTcan locate all the relevant code snip-  
pets at various granularities (file, class, function,  
or line level) for different types of GitHub issues  
through autonomous exploration and analysis.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1 Graph-based Code Representation  
Codebases contain rich structural information, both  
explicit and implicit, that is essential for agent rea-  
soning. Building on this insight, we develop a  
graph-based indexing that comprehensively cap-  
tures codebase relationships while maintaining a  
granularity suitable for the agent to retrieve.  
Code Graph Construction. We construct a het-  
erogeneous directed graphG(V,E,A,R)to index  
\`\`\`

the codebase, whereV={vi}ni= 1 is the node set  
andE⊆V×Vis the edge set. Each nodev∈V  
and each edgee∈Ehas an associated type map-  
ping function. For nodes,τ(v)∶V→Amaps to  
typesA={directory,file,class,function}.  
For edges,φ(e)∶E→Rmaps to relationships  
R \= {contain,import,invoke,inherit}. In  
this paper, we focus our study on Python repos-  
itories and leave codebases with other program-  
ming languages as future work. First, we include  
all directories and Python files as nodes. Then, we  
parse each Python file using the abstract syntax tree  
(AST) to identify inner functions and classes recur-  
sively as nodes. We define the function level as  
the finest node granularity and treat each function’s  
code content as the document for agent retrieval.  
As shown in Figure 2, all nodes with different  
types can be connected as a single tree using the  
containrelationship. This structure supports stan-  
dard codebase-navigation operations. Our code  
graph further incorporates more advanced code in-  
teractions as edges: (1) theinvokerelationship  
from function/class to function/class, where an in-  
voke to a class represents class instantiation; (2)  
theimportrelationship from file to function/class;  
and (3) theinheritrelationship between classes.  
Sparse Hierarchical Entity Indexing.We treat  
nodes in our code graph as entities and build  
hierarchical indexing based on their contents.  
For each keyword, we lookup the indexes from  
top to bottom: (1) We build an entity ID in-  
dex as a unique identifier for each node using  
its fully qualified name. For example, a func-  
tioncalculate\_sumin theMathUtilsclass lo-  
cated insrc/utils.pywould be represented as:  
src/utils.py:MathUtils.calculate\_sum. (2)  
We construct a global dictionary to map the entity  
name (e.g.,calculate\_sum) to all nodes that share  
the same name. (3) We index entity IDs through  
an inverted index (i.e., BM25) to handle keyword  
searches that do not exactly match the IDs or names  
of entities. (4) For cases where input keywords are  
not part of the entities’ IDs (e.g., when a keyword  
refers to a global variable), we build an inverted  
index that maps code chunk(s) to each entity to  
cover all possible matches.

\`\`\`  
Remark.Rather than relying solely on directory  
structures or hierarchical module indexing, our  
approach captures module dependencies that tran-  
scend directory boundaries. Two modules in distant  
directories (A and B) may appear unrelated in tra-

ditional navigation, but if they invoke each other  
or share inheritance, they’re syntactically close in  
our graph representation. This syntactic proximity  
is essential for code localization because issues  
typically manifest through call relationships rather  
than directory structure.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.2 Agent-guided Code Search  
During runtime, LOCAGENT takes issue de-  
scriptions as input and launches agents that au-  
tonomously use predefined tools based on graph  
indexing to localize target code. While the agent  
may iteratively invoke multiple tools internally to  
explore the codebase,LOCAGENToffers a simpli-  
fied interface to users, requiring only a single-turn  
interaction—users submit an issue statement and  
receive localization results without additional input.  
This autonomous, self-contained workflow makes  
LOCAGENTeasy to deploy and highly practical  
for real-world use—with no frequent and computa-  
tionally intensive code embedding generalization  
required beforehand.  
Tool Design for Codebase Exploration.Recent  
works (Xie et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024), inspired  
by GUI-based IDEs, have developed numerous spe-  
cialized tools for agents to explore codebases. How-  
ever, since these tools are primarily designed for  
human readability, they sacrifice the compactness  
and efficiency preferred by LLM agents. Building  
upon our graph-based code representation, we can  
develop tools that support efficient higher-order  
codebase exploration to address these challenges.  
We unify all codebase navigation, search, and view  
operations into three tools (Table 2), introduced as  
follows.  
SearchEntity: This tool searches codebases us-  
ing keywords to locate relevant entities through our  
hierarchical entity index. When an exact match is  
not found in the upper index, the system performs  
a further search using the lower index. For each en-  
\`\`\`

tity found, we return its code snippet in three detail  
levels:fold,preview, andfull code(Figure 6).  
This effectively prevents lengthy code context and  
reduces noise fed into agents.  
TraverseGraph: This tool performs a type-  
aware breadth-first search (BFS) on the code graph,  
starting from input entities and allowing control  
over both traversal direction and number of hops.  
This supports agents to perform arbitrary multi-  
hop codebase navigation through only one action,  
significantly improving the efficiency compared  
with existing agent systems. Note that by allowing  
agents to select entity types and relation types for  
each traversal, this tool effectively leverages the  
LLM agents’ coding expertise to generate proper  
meta paths—a crucial element for heterogeneous  
graph analysis (Lv et al., 2021). For example, by  
specifying entity types to {class,function} and  
relation types to {contain,inherit}, this tool  
returns the UML diagram. Additionally, we de-  
sign an expanded tree-based format for the output  
subgraph that encodes both relation types and di-  
rections (Figure 7). For detailed comparisons with  
alternative graph formats, please see §A.1.2.  
RetreiveEntity: This tool retrieves complete  
entity attributes for each input entity ID, including  
essential information such as file path, line number,  
and code content.  
Chain-of-Thought Agent Planning. We use  
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (shown in §A.3)  
to guide the agent in solving code localization prob-  
lems step by step. The agent systematically follows  
these steps: (1)Keyword extraction.The agent be-  
gins by breaking down the issue statement into  
different categories and then extracts relevant key-  
words that are closely related to the problem. (2)  
Linking keywords to code entities.The agent in-  
vokesSearchEntityto clarify each extracted key-  
word. (3)Generate the logical flow from fault to  
failure.The agent first identifies the entry points  
that trigger the problem. Then, it iteratively tra-  
verse the codebase withTraverseGraph, retrieves  
code contents withRetrieveEntity, and searches  
new keywords withSearchEntity. Finally, it gen-  
erates the logic flow based on the issue and addi-  
tional context. (4)Locate the target entities.The  
agent pinpoints all suspicious code entities that  
need modification based on the logic flow. Then, it  
ranks these entities based on their relevance.  
Confidence Estimation Based on Consistency.  
After generating a complete ranked list of candidate  
entities, to obtain a more consistent ranking, we

\`\`\`  
measure the consistency (Wang et al., 2023a) of  
the LLM’s predictions across multiple iterations.  
Specifically, we use the Reciprocal Rank as the  
initial confidence score for each predicted location.  
We then aggregate the scores for each entity across  
iterations to compute its final confidence score. The  
intuition behind this approach is that if the LLM  
consistently ranks a location higher in multiple  
iterations, it is more likely to be relevant.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.3 Open-source Model Fine-tuning  
Given the high costs of proprietary LLM APIs and  
data security concerns, we fine-tune open-source  
models to improve their code localization capabil-  
ities and enable local deployment. We first col-  
lecte 433 successful trajectories fromClaude-3.5,  
then fine-tunedQwen2.5-32Busing this data. Due  
to budget constraints, an additional 335 success-  
ful trajectories are sampled from the fine-tuned  
Qwen2.5-32B, which is used to further refine the  
32B model for self-improvement. The entire  
dataset, combining both successfulClaude-3.  
andQwen2.5-32Btrajectories, are then used to  
train a smaller 7B model.  
Both models are fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-  
Tuning (SFT) with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), using a  
standard next-token cross-entropy loss. See §C.  
for more training details.

SWE-bench Lite, for code localization, treating the  
patched files and functions as targets. However, ex-  
isting datasets (Tomassi et al., 2019; Jimenez et al.,  
2023\) present challenges for effectively evaluating  
code localization methods. First, they are at risk  
of contamination, as they may include data over-  
lapping with repositories or issues used by mod-  
ern models during pre-training. Second, existing  
datasets are not specifically designed for code lo-  
calization. SWE-Bench, for instance, was created  
primarily to evaluate end-to-end bug-fixing capa-  
bilities, with localization being only an implicit  
intermediate step. This focus results in datasets  
dominated by bug reports (85% of SWE-Bench  
Lite examples) while severely under-representing

\`\`\`  
4.2 Dataset Construction  
To address the limitations of existing benchmarks,  
we introduceLOC-BENCH, a new dataset specif-  
ically designed for code localization. We col-  
lects up-to-date issues from Python repositories  
to mitigate potential contamination concerns in the  
latest LLMs. Additionally,LOC-BENCHcovers  
wider categories, including bug reports, feature re-  
quests, security, and performance issues, enabling  
a more comprehensive evaluation of code localiza-  
tion methods. The statistics ofLOC-BENCHare  
shown in Table 3\.  
For the Bug Report category, we collect GitHub  
issues created after October 2024, which is later  
than the release dates of most modern LLMs. To en-  
rich the dataset with more instances of security and  
performance issues, we use the GitHub Search API  
to search for relevant keywords, such as "latency  
improvement" for performance-related issues. We  
exclude instances modifying more than five Python  
files or more than ten functions in the correspond-  
ing patch. For further details, see §B.

\#\# 5 Experiments

\`\`\`  
Our experiments evaluate four key aspects of  
LOCAGENT: (1) the effectiveness of our graph-  
guided agent for code localization compared to ex-  
isting methods, (2) the performance of fine-tuned  
open source models as cost-effective alternatives  
to proprietary LLMs, (3) a detailed analysis of our  
framework’s and models’ robustness and general-  
ization, and (4) the contribution of each component  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
in our framework through ablation studies. We also  
examine the impact of improved localization on  
downstream software maintenance tasks.  
5.1 Experimental Settings  
Datasets.We conduct experiments on both SWE-  
Bench Lite and our introducedLOC-BENCH. For  
SWE-Bench Lite, following Suresh et al. (2024),  
we treat the patched files and functions as localiza-  
tion targets and exclude examples where no exist-  
ing functions were modified, ultimately retaining  
274 out of the original 300 examples.  
Metrics.To assess performance, we adopt a strict  
top-kaccuracy metric inspired by R-Precision in  
information retrieval. For each example, we con-  
sider a localization successful only ifallrelevant  
locations are correctly identified within the top-k  
predictions. This evaluation measures the ability  
to identify all code sections that require modifi-  
cation. We report results across multiplekval-  
ues: file-level localization using Acc@1, Acc@3,  
and Acc@5, and function-level localization using  
Acc@5 and Acc@10. To offer a more relaxed eval-  
uation, we also assess module-level localization,  
which considers the prediction correct if any func-  
tion within the patched class is identified.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.2 Baselines  
We evaluateLOCAGENTagainst three categories  
of competitive baselines: (a) Retrieval-based meth-  
ods: including the sparse retriever BM25 (Robert-  
son et al., 1994), the general-purpose embedding  
model E5-base-v2 (Wang et al., 2022), and several  
code-specific models such as Jina-Code-v2 (Gün-  
ther et al., 2023), Codesage-large-v2 (Zhang et al.,  
2024a), and the current SOTA CodeRankEm-  
bed (Suresh et al., 2024). Proprietary embeddings  
are excluded due to API cost. (b) Procedure-based  
methods: Agentless (Xia et al., 2024), which local-  
izes code via a hierarchical procedure. (c) Agent-  
based methods: advanced agent frameworks for  
code exploration and modification, including Open-  
Hands (Wang et al., 2025), SWE-Agent (Yang et al.,  
2024), and MoatlessTools (Örwall, 2024). For im-  
plementation details, see §C.1.

5.3 Evaluation Results on SWE-Bench Lite  
As shown in Table 4, agent-based methods con-  
sistently outperform other approaches, and our  
method shows competitive performance by achiev-  
ing best results across all levels of code localization.

less identifies only limited locations due to its nar-  
row repository scope, which hinders performance  
gains when considering a broader set of candidates.  
The NDCG results are presented in Table 11 in the  
appendix.  
To further analyze the results, we examine per-  
formance across different task difficulty levels. We  
measure the task difficulty by calculating the short-  
est hops between the functions mentioned in the  
issue descriptions and the patched functions on  
our code graph (See §C.2 for more details). As

\`\`\`  
shown in Figure 3, performance decreases for all  
methods as the task becomes more challenging.  
However, agent-based methods demonstrate better  
robustness as difficulty increases, with our method  
maintaining competitive performance across dif-  
ficulty levels. Retrieval-based methods, such as  
E5-Base-v2 and CodeRankEmbed, perform poorly  
at the function level, even when the patched func-  
tions are explicitly mentioned in the query. This  
is because they treat the query as a whole, failing  
to capture fine-grained details. Agentless performs  
even worse than retrieval-based methods when ex-  
ploration beyond the query is needed (hop≥ 1 ) due  
to its simplistic localization process and limited  
view focused only on the repository structure.

5.4 Fine-tuned Open-source Models  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Figure 4 shows that after fine-tuning, both the 7B  
and 32B models show significant improvements  
in this task. LOCAGENTwithQwen-2.5-32B(ft)  
achieves performance comparable toClaude-3.5,  
andLOCAGENTwithQwen2.5-7B(ft)also de-  
livers results on par with that obtained using  
GPT-4o. As shown in Table 4, our method with  
Qwen2.5-32B(ft)outperforms nearly all base-  
lines, including those that use larger and more  
powerful LLMs. The original 7B model performs  
poorly due to its limited tool-use capability (Chen  
et al., 2024). These results validate the feasibility  
of deploying our fine-tuned open-source models as  
promising alternatives to proprietary APIs, espe-  
cially in resource-constrained scenarios.

5.5 Efficiency Analysis  
Table 5 presents an efficiency analysis comparing  
agent-based methods in terms of cost and the num-  
ber of agent interactions required. MoatlessTools  
demonstrates good cost-efficiency and requires rel-  
atively fewer rounds of interaction. However, the  
dense embeddings it uses make it difficult and  
slow to adapt to fast-evolving codebases. SWE-  
agent and Openhands also show moderate costs but  
still do not match the efficiency ofLOCAGENT.  
ForLOCAGENTwithClaude-3.5, although more  
rounds of interaction are required, the cost remains  
lower than that of Openhands, illustrating the to-  
ken efficiency of our tools’ outputs.LOCAGENT  
with fine-tuned Qwen models stands out for its su-  
perior efficiency^1. Qwen2.5-7B(ft)is the most  
cost-efficient option, requiring only $0.05 per ex-  
ample, whileQwen2.5-32B(ft)offers a more cost-  
effective alternative toClaude-3.5. These results  
highlight the potential of fine-tuned open-source  
(^1) We calculate the cost based on the prices from AI infer-  
ence providers (Hyperbolic, 2025; artificialanalysis.ai, 2025).  
Specifically, for theQwen2.5-32B(ft)model, the cost we  
use is $0.20/1M tokens for both input and output. For the  
Qwen2.5-7B(ft)model, the cost we use is $0.14/1M tokens  
for input and $0.28/1M tokens for output.

5.6 Ablation Study  
We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effec-  
tiveness of each component of our toolsets. Due  
to budget constraints, we useQwen-2.5-7B(ft)as  
the localization model for these experiments.  
(1) Each tool plays a critical role. As  
shown in Table 6, removing any tool, especially  
SearchEntity, leads to varying degrees of accu-  
racy degradation, particularly in module and func-  
tion level localization.  
(2) Graph structure provides essential informa-  
tion for localization. RemovingTraverseGraph  
tool decreases module- and function-level perfor-  
mance since the agent lacks structure informa-  
tion and must infer relationships through reason-  
ing. Adding only thecontainrelationship yields  
marginal improvements, emphasizing the impor-  
tance of the other three types of relationship and  
explaining why our method surpasses baselines re-  
lying only on the repository structure.  
(3) Multi-hop exploration is crucial for deep  
code understanding.Compared to the full setting,  
fixingHops=1leads to a more significant decrease  
in function-level accuracy, underscoring the im-  
portance of multi-hop exploration for identifying  
relevant entities.  
(4) Sparse indexing is essential for performance.  
RemovingSearchEntitytool, or even partial re-  
moval of its index, causes a substantial drop in per-  
formance across all metrics. This demonstrates the  
effectiveness of building a sparse index on our code  
graph for improving localization performance.

sults highlight the practicality ofQwen2.5-7B(ft)  
model for real-world applications. Despite being an  
open-source alternative, it achieves a performance  
comparable toClaude-3.5. We also evaluate per-  
formance across four categories. Figure 5 clearly  
shows that our method outperforms others in al-  
most all categories of code localization. However,

\`\`\`  
it also highlights a noticeable decrease in perfor-  
mance across the other three categories compared  
to the Bug Report category. This performance gap  
likely stems from the distribution of our training  
data, which contained more bug report examples,  
potentially leading to scaffolds better optimized  
for bug localization tasks. This trend suggests that,  
while our method is highly effective for bug report  
localization, there is still room for improvement  
in handling the other categories through category-  
specific optimization strategies and more balanced  
training data.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.8 Application: Better Localization Leads to  
More Solved GitHub Issues  
To assess the impact of localization methods on  
downstream tasks, we evaluated their effectiveness  
in solving GitHub issues. We choose Agentless  
as the baseline, ranking among the top-performing  
open-source submissions on SWE-Bench Lite. For  
consistency, we utilizedClaude-3.5as the editing  
model in conjunction with the Agentless editing  
method. Table 8 shows that the success rate for  
solving GitHub issues improves significantly with  
better code localization accuracy.

\#\# 6 Conclusion

\`\`\`  
In conclusion,LOCAGENTenhances code localiza-  
tion by parsing codebases as graphs, enabling effi-  
cient repository-level exploration for LLM agents.  
With fine-tuned open-source models, our method  
achieves high localization accuracy while greatly  
reducing costs compared to larger proprietary mod-  
els. Experimental results demonstrate the effective-  
ness ofLOCAGENTin identifying relevant code  
blocks and supporting downstream tasks.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# Limitations

\`\`\`  
First, our study primarily focused on fine-tuning  
Qwen-2.5-Codermodels. Exploring a broader  
\`\`\`

range of base models, including other open-source  
LLMs like CodeLlama, Mistral, or Yi, could pro-  
vide valuable insights into model selection trade-  
offs. Additionally, investigating different fine-  
tuning approaches beyond LoRA, such as full fine-  
tuning or other parameter-efficient methods, could  
potentially yield better performance.  
Moreover, though we demonstrated improved  
bug repair performance with better localization,  
we only scratched the surface of potential down-  
stream applications. Future work should evaluate  
LocAgent’s impact on other software engineering  
tasks like refactoring, feature addition, security vul-  
nerability patching, and performance optimization.  
This would provide a more comprehensive under-  
standing of the practical utility of the framework.  
Finally, the current evaluation focuses primar-  
ily on Python codebases. ExtendingLOCAGENT  
to support other programming languages and eval-  
uating its performance across different language  
paradigms would better demonstrate its generaliz-  
ability.

\#\# A LOCAGENTDesign Details

A.1 Tool Output Design  
A.1.1 Three-level format for \*\*SearchEntity\*\*  
output  
Once invoked by the LLM agent, the retrieval APIs  
search for files, classes, methods, and code snippets  
in the codebase, and return the results back to the  
agent. To avoid forming a very lengthy code con-  
text that may contain noisy information to LLM, we  
return only necessary information as API outputs.  
To achieve this, we designed four granular standard  
output formats (Figure 6):fold,preview,full  
code. Specifically, the API adapts its output based  
on the number and size of retrieved entities: when  
the number of matched entities is small (≤3), it  
returns theirfull code; for large files, it provides  
apreview, summarizing the module structure (e.g.,  
class/method signatures); and when the number of  
matches exceeds 3, it outputs a compactfoldfor-  
mat that only lists entity identifiers. This design  
ensures that the agent receives sufficient context  
without overwhelming its input window.

A.1.2 Tree-based Subgraph Formatting for  
\*\*TraverseGraph\*\* Output  
TheTraverseGraphtool performs breadth-first  
traversal over the code graph, returning a local  
subgraph for each input entity. These subgraphs  
help the agent reason about complex dependen-  
cies surrounding the entity. However, reasoning  
over graphs remains a challenge for LLMs. Prior  
work (Fatemi et al., 2023\) shows that LLM per-  
formance can vary significantly depending on how  
graphs are encoded into text, making the design  
of the subgraph output format a critical factor. We  
leave the exploration of applying more advanced  
and efficient graph traversal strategies (Deng et al.,  
2023\) for LLM Agents as future work.  
We have developed a new tree-based format,  
shown in Figure 7, with several features that en-  
hance LLM reasoning: (1) We represent subgraphs  
as trees, allowing LLMs to use indentation to  
determine a node’s distance from the root, (2) We  
display complete entity IDs for each node (e.g.,  
django/core/validators.py:RegexValidator)  
to help LLMs locate nodes easily, and (3) We  
explicitly specify relation types for each edge,  
including reversed relations  
To evaluate how different graph formats impact  
code localization performance, we conducted an ex-  
periment using 37 challenging samples from SWE-

\`\`\`  
Bench-Lite. These samples were considered "chal-  
lenging" because they could not be solved by any  
baseline agent methods. UsingClaude-3.5as the  
Localization Model across all settings, we com-  
pared various output formats. Table 9 presents our  
findings. The baseline output formats we tested are  
described below:  
\`\`\`  
\- row: For each line, list one row of the adja-  
    cency matrix. For example,  
    function "fileA.py:funcA" invokes function  
    "fileA.py:funcB", "fileA.py:funcC"  
\- row (w/ entity attributes): Additionally in-  
    clude entity attributes (e.g., code content) for  
    formatrow.  
\- incident: The incident format mentioned  
    in (Fatemi et al., 2023). An integer instead of  
    entity ID is used to represent each node. For  
    example,  
    Map function "fileA.py:funcA" to index 0\. Map  
    function "fileA.py:funcB" to index 1\. Map  
    function "fileA.py:funcC" to index 2\.  
    function 0 invokes function 1,2.  
\- Graphviz DOT: Represent graph in Graphviz  
    DOT language (Ellson et al., 2002).  
\- JSON: Expand the subgraph as a tree, and  
    convert it to JSON format.

\`\`\`  
As shown in Table 9, expanding subgraphs as  
trees (i.e.,JSON,tree-based) can significantly im-  
prove the performance. Ourtree-basedformat  
achieves the best overall performance across dif-  
ferent levels of localization tasks. We also test re-  
turning entity attributes along with subgraphs. We  
notice thatrow (w/ entity attributes)consistently  
underperformsrow, indicating the attributes for all  
the nodes may be very noisy. Besides, although us-  
ing incident format can simplify the output and  
show improvements in file-level localization, it  
degradation the module- and file-level localization.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
A.2 Implementation  
To enable the LLM agent to invoke the Code Local-  
ization APIs, we handle the interaction differently  
based on the LLM’s capabilities. For LLMs that  
support tool-calling features, we define the tools  
as a list of JSON objects, which are then used as  
parameters for the API calls. For LLMs that do

Figure 7: A truncated example of the expanded tree-based format for the output subgraph of toolTraverseGraph.  
not support tool-calling (such as Qwen), we pro-  
vide the description of the API and the expected  
output as part of the LLM’s prompt. When the  
agent decides to invoke a set of retrieval APIs, it  
responds with a list of API call names and their  
corresponding arguments. These retrieval API re-  
quests are processed locally by searching over the  
built code graph. The results from executing these  
APIs locally are returned to the agent.  
By default, we query the LLM with a tempera-  
ture setting of 1.0. We conducttwointeractions,  
after which we rerank the results based on mean  
reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. We also leverage  
multiprocess execution to speed up the process.  
Since all of our tools are read-only,LOCAGENT  
does not require a specialized Docker environment  
to operate.

A.4 Supported Programming Languages  
While our current implementation focuses on  
Python codebases, our method is not inherently  
tied to Python. LocAgent constructs a lightweight  
graph representation of the codebase, which is built  
from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) generated from  
the source code. Specifically, we employtree-sitter

library to generate ASTs, andtree-sittersupports  
a wide range of programming languages beyond  
Python, including C, C++, Java, Go, and many oth-  
ers. Thus, extending our approach to other object-  
oriented or procedural languages would be rela-  
tively straightforward.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# B Dataset construction details

We provide a more thorough clarification of the  
dataset construction process below:  
Issue Sourcing.For the Bug Report and Feature  
Request categories, we select open-source Python  
repositories on GitHub with over 5,000 stars to en-  
sure code quality and project reliability. We then  
collect associated pull requests (PRs), each associ-  
ated with a codebase specified by its base commit  
following (Jimenez et al., 2023). To gather security  
and performance issues, we use the GitHub Search  
API with targeted keywords (listed in Table 10\) to  
identify relevant PRs.  
Issue Filtering.We filter out PRs that do not ex-  
plicitly resolve any linked GitHub issue. In ad-  
dition, we exclude large-scope changes involving  
more than 5 Python files or more than 10 functions,  
as such large-scale changes are often too broad  
and may not represent a single, isolated bug fix or  
improvement. PRs that do not involve any function-  
level edits are also discarded to ensure meaningful  
localization targets.  
Category Labeling.we useGPT-4o-2024-  
to classify each issue based on its description. To  
ensure reliability, we sample the result three times  
for each issue and apply manual review in cases  
where the outputs are inconsistent, reducing poten-  
tial noise and labeling errors.  
Ground Truth Locations. The affected files or  
functions in the original codebase, as identified in  
the patches, are considered the target locations for  
the given issue. While it is possible to fix a bug  
in a location different from the ground truth, the

\`\`\`  
extracted ground-truth locations still serve as ap-  
proximate targets for localization. Additionally,  
edited code such as documents, import statements,  
and comments are excluded from the localization  
target. These elements are not considered relevant  
for code localization, as they do not directly im-  
pact the functionality of the code or its execution.  
By filtering out these elements, the focus is main-  
tained on the core code changes that are relevant  
for localization.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# C Implementation Details

\`\`\`  
C.1 Baselines Implementation  
Regarding the embedding-based methods in our  
evaluation, while these approaches could theoreti-  
cally index nodes at different levels (file, module,  
or function) to compute corresponding metrics, the  
standard implementations we evaluated operate at  
the function level, embedding each function as a  
single unit, following (Suresh et al., 2024).  
We use OpenHands with its default generalist

its agenthub. We use Openhands version 0.12.

C.2 Quantifying Task Difficulty Based on  
Code Graph Distance  
We measure task difficulty by computing the av-  
erage shortest hop distance between the functions  
mentioned in the issue descriptions and the patched  
functions within our code graph. Specifically, we  
first extract potential function names from each  
issue description usingGPT-4o-2024-0513, and  
identify their corresponding nodes in the code  
graph using the global dictionary. These identified  
nodes form the set of predicted nodes, denoted asC.

Similarly, we link the ground truth functions from  
the patch to their corresponding nodes in the code  
graph, forming the set of target nodes, denoted as  
T. To quantify the difficultyδ, we calculate the av-  
erage shortest hop distance between the predicted  
nodesCand the target nodesT, defined as:

mance analysis stratified by difficulty, we roundδ  
down to⌊δ⌋to group samples by difficulty levels,  
and we exclude samples where the LLM fails to  
extract any valid function names.

C.3 Fine-tuning details  
\`\`\`  
We do not use explicit teacher-student distillation  
techniques (e.g., loss alignment or intermediate rep-  
resentation matching); instead, our data-centric dis-  
tillation strategy effectively transfers task-specific  
reasoning abilities to the smaller model. We use  
Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct(Hui et al., 2024\) 7B

\`\`\`  
and 32B variants as our base models. We fine-tuned  
Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct7B and 32B models  
on 768 training samples from the SWE-Bench train-  
ing dataset, leveraging LoRA for efficient adapta-  
tion. The training set included 447 samples gen-  
erated byClaude-3.5, while the remaining sam-  
ples were iteratively generated using the fine-tuned  
Qwen2.5-32Bmodel. The fine-tuning process was  
conducted over 5 epochs withmax\_tokenset to  
128 kand a learning rate of 2 × 10 −^4.

Given the following GitHub problem description, your objective is to localize the specific files, classes or functions, and lines  
of code that need modification or contain key information to resolve the issue.  
Follow these steps to localize the issue:  
\#\# Step 1: Categorize and Extract Key Problem Information

\- Classify the problem statement into the following categories:Problem description, error trace, code to reproduce the bug, and additional context.  
\- Identify modules in the '{{package\_name}}' package mentioned in each category.  
\- Use extracted keywords and line numbers to search for relevant code references for additional context.  
\#\# Step 2: Locate Referenced Modules-Accurately determine specific modules  
    \- Explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.  
\- \-Pay special attention to distinguishing between modules with similar names using context and described execution flow.Analyze the described execution flow to identify specific modules or components being referenced.  
\- Output Format for collected relevant modules:  
    \- \-Use the format: 'E.g., for a function \`file\_path:calculate\_sumQualifiedName\` in the \`’ MathUtils\` class located in \`src/helpers/math\_helpers.py\`, represent it as:  
       'src/helpers/math\_helpers.py:MathUtils.calculate\_sum'.  
\#\# Step 3: Analyze and Reproducing the Problem  
\- Clarify the Purpose of the Issue  
    \- If expanding capabilities: Identify where and how to incorporate new behavior, fields, or modules.  
    \- If addressing unexpected behavior: Focus on localizing modules containing potential bugs.  
\- Reconstruct the execution flow  
    \- \-Identify main entry points triggering the issue.Trace function calls, class interactions, and sequences of events.  
    \- Identify potential breakpoints causing the issue.  
    Important: Keep the reconstructed flow focused on the problem, avoiding irrelevant details.  
\#\# Step 4: Locate Areas for Modification-Locate specific files, functions, or lines of code requiring changes or containing critical information for resolving the issue.  
\- Consider upstream and downstream dependencies that may affect or be affected by the issue.  
\- \-If applicable, identify where to introduce new fields, functions, or variables.Think Thoroughly: List multiple potential solutions and consider edge cases that could impact the resolution.

\#\# Output Format for Final Results:Your final output should list the locations requiring modification, wrapped with triple backticks \`\`\`  
Each location should include the file path, class name (if applicable), function name, or line numbers, ordered by importance.  
Your answer would better include about 5 files.  
\#\#\# Examples:  
\`\`\`full\_path1/file1.py  
line: 10  
class: MyClass  
function: my\_function  
full\_path2/file2.pyline: 76  
function: MyClass2.my\_function  
full\_path3/file3.py  
line: 24line: 156  
function: my\_function  
\`\`\`  
Return just the location(s)  
Note: Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
