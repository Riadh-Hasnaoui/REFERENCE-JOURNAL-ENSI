Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in automating software engineering tasks,  
spurring the emergence of coding agents that scaffold LLMs with external tools to resolve repository-level  
problems. However, existing agents still struggle to navigate large-scale codebases, as the “Needle-in-a-Haystack”  
problem persists even with million-token context windows, where relevant evidence is often overwhelmed  
by large volumes of irrelevant code and documentation. Prior codebase navigation approaches, including  
embedding-based retrieval, file-system exploration, and graph-based retrieval, address parts of this challenge  
but fail to capture the temporal continuity of agent reasoning, rendering agents stateless and causing repeated  
repository traversals that hinder scalable planning and reasoning.  
To address these limitations, we present Prometheus, a memory-centric coding agent framework for  
long-horizon codebase navigation. Prometheus represents the repository as a unified knowledge graph  
to encode semantic dependencies and employs a context engine augmented with working memory that  
retains and reuses previously explored contexts to ensure continuity across reasoning steps. Built upon  
this engine, Prometheus integrates memory-enhanced navigation into a multi-agent system for automated  
issue resolution, encompassing issue classification, bug reproduction, patch generation, and verification.  
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two widely used issue resolution benchmarks, i.e., SWE-bench  
Verified and SWE-PolyBench Verified. Powered by GPT-5, Prometheus achieves state-of-the-art performance  
with 74.4% and 33.8% resolution rates on the two benchmarks, ranking Top-6 and Top-1 among open-source  
agent systems, respectively. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/EuniAI/Prometheus.

1 Introduction  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in automating software  
engineering tasks, including code generation \[ 15 , 16 , 21 \], code summarization \[ 34 , 36 \], and program  
repair \[ 25 , 47 , 48 , 52 \]. Driven by this progress, coding agents have emerged as autonomous  
systems that scaffold LLMs with external tools to accomplish complex, repository-level tasks  
in real development environments \[ 17 , 29 \], as exemplified by SWE-agent \[ 44 \], AutoCodeRover \[ 53 \],  
and OpenHands \[38\].  
Despite substantial progress, existing coding agents still struggle to navigate large-scale codebases  
that comprise millions of lines of code and intricate dependency relationships. While recent LLMs  
have dramatically expanded their context windows to millions of tokens and beyond \[ 5 , 12 , 33 \],  
these models still face the “Needle-in-a-Haystack” challenge \[ 13 , 23 \]. Specifically, task-relevant  
context evidence is overwhelmed by large volumes of irrelevant content, leading to inaccurate  
retrieval and degraded reasoning. Here, context refers to code and accompanying documentation  
relevant to issue resolution. As a result, effective codebase navigation for retrieving relevant  
context remains crucial for enabling long-horizon reasoning and decision-making throughout  
repository-level workflows.  
Existing Approaches and Limitations. A straightforward navigation approach for coding agents  
is to apply embedding-based semantic retrieval, as illustrated in Figure 1 (a), which encodes code  
chunks into embeddings and ranks them by their cosine similarity to the query embedding \[ 6 , 31 ,  
39 , 50 \]. While enabling efficient navigation without step-by-step exploration, this approach relies  
heavily on chunking and embedding quality; irrelevant or noisy retrieval results can mislead the  
agent and degrade subsequent reasoning. Another line of work adopts file-system navigation, as  
illustrated in Figure 1 (b), which grounds context retrieval within the codebase by executing shell  
commands (e.g.,ls,find, andgrep) \[ 4 , 6 , 26 , 38 \] or interacting through specialized interfaces \[ 40 ,  
44 \]. However, this method lacks a global view of the repository architecture, resulting in a  
fragmented understanding of the codebase that impairs long-horizon reasoning and planning.  
More importantly, both approaches are limited in handling the intricate semantic dependencies  
within the codebase, which are essential for repository-level problem solving.  
Recently, structure-aware navigation has emerged as a promising alternative for coding agents \[ 9 ,  
27 , 35 , 42 , 53 \], as shown in Figure 1 (c), which models the repository as a graph, where nodes  
represent code entities (e.g., files, classes, and functions) and edges capture their dependencies (e.g.,  
syntax trees, control flows, and data flows). By explicitly encoding the hierarchical structure of the  
repository, these agents achieve powerful multi-hop reasoning and deep context retrieval across  
complex codebases. While these agents effectively capture the spatial topology of the codebase,  
they fail to model the temporal history of their own exploration. They operate essentially as  
stateless functions, lacking persistent memory of previously explored code. As a result, agents  
repeatedly traverse the same regions of the repository, incurring substantial computational overhead.

Consequently, current agents remain inadequate for planning, reasoning, and memorizing required  
to navigate complex software systems on par with human developers.  
Our Work: Long-Horizon Codebase Navigation via Memory. To address this gap, this paper  
introduces Prometheus, a memory-centric coding agent framework that models codebase navigation  
from a temporal perspective, enabling long-horizon reasoning in repository-level workflows such  
as bug fixing, feature implementation, and refactoring. Specifically, Prometheus transforms the  
codebase into a unified knowledge graph that captures complex semantic dependencies and serves  
as the foundation for context retrieval. Subsequently, Prometheus employs a context engine  
augmented with working memory, as illustrated in Figure 1 (d), which automatically retains  
and reuses previously explored contexts to maintain continuity across reasoning steps. Finally,  
Prometheus integrates the context engine into a multi-agent system for automated issue resolution,  
where specialized agents for issue classification, bug reproduction, patch generation, and patch  
verification operate sequentially under memory-enhanced navigation.  
We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of Prometheus using  
the state-of-the-art LLM (i.e., GPT-5 \[ 33 \]) on two widely used issue resolution benchmarks (i.e.,  
SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \] and SWE-PolyBench Verified \[ 30 \]). Experimental results demonstrate  
that Prometheus achieves leading performance with 74.4% and 33.8% resolution rates on the two  
benchmarks, ranking Top-6 and Top-1 among open-sourced agent systems, respectively, at the  
time of writing. In particular, Prometheus achieves over 30% balanced resolution rate across Java,  
Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, indicating its strong multilingual generalization and consistent  
cross-language performance on SWE-PolyBench Verified. Moreover, we conduct a fine-grained  
analysis of context retrieval performance by comparing retrieved contexts against human-annotated  
gold standards. Results show that Prometheus significantly outperforms leading agents, such  
as Agentless \[ 39 \], SWE-agent \[ 44 \], and OpenHands \[ 38 \], retrieving a higher proportion of gold  
contexts at the file, function/class, and span levels under the same GPT-5 backbone. Our ablation  
study further demonstrates that the working memory mechanism reduces LLM invocation cost by  
45.4% while improving the issue resolution rate by 25%.  
Contributions. The primary contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.

\- Memory-Enhanced Context Retrieval. We propose a novel context retrieval approach  
    augmented with working memory, which models the temporal trajectory of agent navigation.  
    This mechanism enables agents to automatically retain and reuse previously explored contexts,  
    achieving continuity and coherence in long-horizon reasoning.

\- Prometheus: A Novel Issue Resolution Agent. We develop Prometheus, a multi-agent  
    system that integrates memory-enhanced navigation into issue resolution workflows. This  
    system coordinates specialized agents for issue classification, bug reproduction, patch generation,  
    and patch verification, establishing a unified workflow for automated issue resolution at the  
    repository level.  
\- Extensive Evaluation and Analysis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely  
    used issue resolution benchmarks (i.e., SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \] and SWE-PolyBench Verified \[ 30 \]),  
    demonstrating the superiority of Prometheus over existing agent systems. We further demonstrate  
    the superiority of Prometheus in both context retrieval and multilingual adaptability, and  
    validate the effectiveness of the working memory mechanism.

2 Methodology

Figure 2 presents an overview of Prometheus, which is composed of three core components:  
(A) Repository to Knowledge Graph, which constructs a unified code index representing the  
structural and semantic relationships within the target codebase; (B) Memory Enhanced Context  
Retrieval, which enables effective identification and reuse of relevant code and documentation to  
support reasoning; and (C) Multi-Agent Architectural Design, which coordinates specialized  
agents to collaboratively perform issue resolution tasks. The following sections describe each  
component in detail.

2.1 Repository to Knowledge Graph

To facilitate semantic understanding and context retrieval across large-scale codebases, we propose  
a unified knowledge graph representation that integrates file structures, ASTs, and textual content  
into a coherent graph abstraction. As shown in Figure 3, our knowledge graph is built around three  
core components: (1) defining a node and edge schema, (2) constructing the graph from source files,  
and (3) persisting the graph data in a scalable database.

\`\`\`  
Graph Schema. The knowledge graph represents codebases as heterogeneous graphs composed  
\`\`\`  
of three primary node types:❶ FileNode ,❷ ASTNode , and❸ TextNode. AFileNode  
represents a file or directory with three attributes: a uniquenode\_id, therelative\_pathfrom  
the repository root, and thebasenameof the file or directory. It anchors structural links in the  
knowledge graph. AnASTNoderepresents a Tree-sitter syntax node. It includes a uniquenode\_id,  
thestart\_lineandend\_lineindicating its position in the source file, the text of the code it covers  
(including comments), and its type, per the Tree-sitter grammar node type. ATextNoderepresents  
a chunk of unstructured textual content in the knowledge graph. EachTextNodeis associated

\`\`\`

\`\`\`

with a uniquenode\_id, descriptivemeta\_data, and the corresponding text span. TextNodes are  
extracted from documentation-oriented file types, including.markdown,.md,.txt, and.rst. The  
text is segmented into chunks based on a configurablechunk\_size. Depending on the file content  
and structure, adaptive splitters are applied using hierarchical separators, including paragraph-level  
(\\n\\n), line-level (\\n), word-level (space), and character-level splitting.  
To capture relationships across FileNodes, ASTNodes, and TextNodes, we define five directed  
edge types. These relationships are essential for representing the structural, syntactic, and lexical  
context necessary for code understanding and issue resolution. TheHAS\_FILEedge (black) connects  
directories to their child files or subdirectories, preserving the repository hierarchy. TheHAS\_AST  
edge (purple) links each file node to the root of its corresponding abstract syntax tree.PARENT\_OF  
edges (gray) connect AST nodes to reflect syntactic hierarchy within the tree.HAS\_TEXTedges  
(blue) associate file nodes with their segmented textual content, andNEXT\_CHUNKedges (orange)  
connect sequential text chunks to maintain document order. Together, these relationships enable  
the graph to represent structural, syntactic, and lexical information in an integrated and practical  
format, exposing the repository knowledge graph through a set of structured query tools.  
To our knowledge, this work introduces a highly extensible knowledge graph schema that  
unifies repository structure, program syntax, and unstructured text. In contrast to prior graph-  
based approaches \[ 27 \] that rely on specialized or task-coupled designs, we adopt a deliberately  
minimal yet expressive schema, consisting of only three node types and a small set of well-defined  
relations. On SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \], we observe an average knowledge graph construction  
time of 1.99 seconds per instance over all 500 instances, indicating that the proposed schema is  
lightweight enough for practical, large-scale use. This simplicity enables efficient graph construction  
and incremental updates as codebases evolve, while preserving sufficient structural and semantic  
coverage for repository-level reasoning. Consequently, the resulting knowledge graph provides  
a reusable substrate for tasks such as semantic retrieval, long-horizon dependency analysis, and  
agent-based code navigation, without requiring task-specific re-engineering.  
2.2 Memory-Enhanced Context Retrieval  
2.2.1 Context Retrieval Engine. As shown in Figure 4, the Context Retrieval Engine adopts a three-  
stage retrieval cycle that incrementally maps a high-level intent expressed in natural language  
to structured contextual evidence. As summarized in Algorithm 1, the process begins with Sub-  
query Synthesis, where a structured and specific sub-query in natural language is generated with  
high-level intent and the current collected context. The sub-query is formulated as a ternary tuple  
comprising an essential query, which captures the core information needed, extra requirements,

which encode retrieval constraints such as prioritizing specific files or truncating oversized artifacts,  
and a purpose, which specifies the motivation or objective of the retrieval. Figure 5 provides an  
example and illustration for both high-level intent and its corresponding sub-query. For example,  
a high-level intent to “locate authentication bugs” can generate a structured query targeting  
authentication-related classes, decorators, and their associated call sites.  
Following synthesis, the context engine performs sub-query guided context retrieval and context  
organization under a memory-first protocol. As shown in Algorithm 1, the system first retrieves  
from the working memory for previously stored context associated with the current sub-query. If  
no relevant context is retrieved, the engine exposes the repository knowledge graph through a set  
of structured search tools, allowing the LLM to iteratively traverse file-level and AST-level nodes via  
multi-hop relations. Guided by the sub-query, the LLM autonomously decides which graph relations  
to follow and when to expand or stop traversal. For the set of discovered contexts, the engine  
first performs a structural deduplication by cross-referencing their file paths and line-number  
intervals (𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 \_𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑒𝑛𝑑 \_𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒). These contexts are categorized relative to each other as duplicate,  
contained, contains, or separate. For those identified as non-redundant, the LLM then performs an  
extraction step to distill the most relevant information. The engine keeps the code’s structure intact  
by grouping snippets by their source files and restoring their original order, forming a validated  
context. The validated contexts is then stored in memory for future use. This process is repeated  
and dynamically updated.  
2.2.2 Working Memory. The goal of working memory is to prevent Prometheus from repeated  
query and reduce the token cost. As shown in Figure 4, the working memory system in Prometheus  
implements a structured and persistent context layer for repository-level evidence. We define a  
context unit as a minimal reusable piece of context, represented as a tuple of (code snippet, metadata),  
where metadata includes the originating file path and start/end line numbers. Working memory  
maintains a set of memory records, each functioning as a logical container that binds a structured  
sub-query (as synthesized by the Context Engine) to its corresponding context units. This design  
ensures that retrieval is not treated as a monolithic string search; instead, subsequent reasoning  
steps can perform fine-grained lookups by aligning their intent with the structured sub-queries  
preserved within the memory records. By the definition of agent memory in recent surveys on  
agentic memory systems \[ 14 \], this module is classified as an agent memory component rather

than a standard RAG module, because it maintains a persistent and continually updated internal  
memory instead of retrieving from a static external corpus.  
Storage. Unlike conventional agentic memory that embeds a single concatenated query into  
one vector, Prometheus adopts a Multi-vector Weighted Retrieval design. For each synthesized  
sub-query comprising three distinct fields—essential query, extra requirements, and purpose—the  
storage pipeline computes semantic embeddings for these fields using a configurable embedding  
model API. This process yields a 3-vector representation for each memory record, which is then  
persisted in a database. Each vector is stored in a dedicated column, denoted as e𝑒𝑠𝑠, e𝑟𝑒𝑞, and  
e𝑝𝑢𝑟, representing the essential query, extra requirement, and purpose of the sub-query, respectively.  
These are stored alongside their corresponding text fields for traceability and debugging. These  
memory records are linked to their associated context units, and insertion is executed as a single  
database transaction (memory record, context unit, and linkage) to ensure referential integrity  
under concurrent agent execution.  
Retrieval. During retrieval, the system encodes the structured input query into the same set  
of query vectors (q𝑒𝑠𝑠,q𝑟𝑒𝑞,q𝑝𝑢𝑟). Prior work \[ 18 \] has shown that aggregating multiple similarity  
signals via weighted linear combination is a standard and theoretically well-founded practice in  
information retrieval. For a candidate memory record𝑚, we compute a weighted similarity score  
by aggregating cosine similarities across the three vectors:  
𝑠(𝑚)= 𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑠· cos(q𝑒𝑠𝑠, e𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠)+ 𝑤𝑟𝑒𝑞· cos(q𝑟𝑒𝑞, e𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑞)+ 𝑤𝑝𝑢𝑟· cos(q𝑝𝑢𝑟, e𝑚𝑝𝑢𝑟),  
where𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑠,𝑤𝑟𝑒𝑞,𝑤𝑝𝑢𝑟control the relative importance of each intent component. To accelerate  
nearest-neighbor search, we build IVFFlat indexes over the vector columns and perform retrieval  
in two stages: (i) run approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search independently for each vector  
column to obtain top-𝑛candidates per component; (ii) take the union of candidates and re-rank  
them using the aggregated score𝑠(𝑚). Finally, we filter results below a similarity threshold and  
return the top-𝑘memory records, whose linked context units are provided as reusable evidence for  
downstream reasoning. This multi-vector weighted retrieval improves alignment between query  
intent and stored evidence, enhancing precision (by respecting auxiliary constraints) and recall (by  
capturing purpose-level signals) compared to single-vector agentic memory baselines.  
2.3 Multi-Agent Architectural Design  
As shown in Figure 6, the architecture of Prometheus consists of four primary functional agents,  
unified by a workflow. The orchestration follows a pipeline from issue classification to verified

resolution, where the context and retrieved knowledge are shared across the Issue Classification  
Agent, Bug Reproduction Agent, Patch Generation Agent, and Patch Verification Agent.

\`\`\`  
2.3.1 Issue Classification Agent. The Issue Classification Agent serves as the intelligent gateway  
of Prometheus, tasked with analyzing and categorizing incoming repository issues into distinct  
types, such as bug, feature, or refactoring. By performing this context-aware classification prior  
to repair planning, the agent enables the system to route heterogeneous issues to specialized  
downstream workflows, ensuring that each problem type is addressed by a tailored resolution  
strategy. This architectural choice constitutes a key novelty of our system. Unlike prior automatic  
program repair pipelines that are narrowly scoped to bug fixing, our approach explicitly generalizes  
issue understanding to reflect real-world software maintenance practices. By moving away from  
a uniform bug-fixing paradigm, Prometheus can function as a general-purpose agentic issue  
resolution system, capable of handling the diverse mixture of problem types found in modern issue  
trackers.  
2.3.2 Bug Reproduction Agent. The Bug Reproduction Agent aims to automatically construct  
a minimal yet executable reproduction of reported bugs, serving as a concrete and verifiable  
foundation for subsequent repair. Given an issue report consisting of the title, description, and  
discussion history, the agent first synthesizes a structured reproduction context that captures the  
expected failure behavior and relevant environmental assumptions. In real-world issue resolution,  
such a reproduction is indispensable, as it transforms ambiguous natural language descriptions into  
\`\`\`

a deterministic test oracle. This design reflects Prometheus’s commitment to evidence-based repair;  
by grounding the resolution process in a verifiable reproduction script, the system ensures that  
proposed fixes are validated against the actual failure, significantly reducing the risk of regression  
or incomplete repair in complex, large-scale repositories.  
To ground reproduction in repository semantics, the agent retrieves issue-relevant code and  
documentation context through the context retrieval engine. This retrieved context is then used to  
guide the synthesis of reproduction artifacts, including test scripts, driver code, or configuration  
changes, depending on the project’s build system and testing conventions (e.g., Maven, npm, or  
custom commands). Reproduction is realized through an iterative write–execute–analyze loop. The  
agent incrementally modifies the codebase or test suite to introduce reproduction logic, materializes  
these changes as explicit patches, and deploys them to the execution environment. Within this  
environment, the agent executes synthesized reproduction commands to empirically validate  
whether the reported failure can be reliably triggered. Execution results are analyzed by an LLM via  
simple few-shot prompting that determines whether the bug has been successfully reproduced. If  
reproduction fails, the agent leverages execution logs and diagnostic feedback from prior attempts  
to iteratively refine the reproduction procedure. This feedback-driven loop continues until a  
reproducible failure is established or a predefined iteration budget is reached.  
By producing executable reproduction tests and verified failure traces, the Bug Reproduction  
Agent transforms ambiguous natural-language bug reports into concrete, measurable failure cases.  
This not only stabilizes the repair objective but also provides a precise baseline against which  
candidate patches can be evaluated in later stages of the pipeline.  
2.3.3 Patch Generation Agent. The Patch Generation Agent adapts its orchestration strategy based  
on the outcome of the Bug Reproduction Agent. We categorize bugs into two types: verified bugs,  
where a reproduction test has successfully triggered the failure, and unverified bugs, where a  
deterministic reproduction could not be established, or the issue pertains to feature requests and  
refactoring.

\`\`\`  
For a verified bug, the agent initiates a targeted retrieval process via the Context Retrieval Engine  
to gather localized context. During the subsequent analysis phase, the LLM is equipped with a web  
search tool to cross-reference external documentation or similar issues, enabling it to synthesize  
a comprehensive bug fix plan. Following this plan, the agent iteratively edits the source code to  
generate a candidate patch. If the generated patch does not pass through the Patch Verification  
Agent, the Patch Generation Agent re-enters the analysis loop to further refine its fix. This iterative  
generation process continues until a plausible patch is produced. In contrast, for an unverified bug,  
the agent follows a modified workflow that bypasses test-grounded reasoning. While the initial  
context retrieval and planning phases remain consistent, the agent compensates for the lack of  
test-based validation by executing the generation process multiple times. This results in a diverse  
set of candidate patches, allowing the system to explore multiple potential fix hypotheses through  
repeated sampling rather than relying on a single iterative refinement loop.

2.3.4 Patch Verification Agent. The Patch Verification Agent evaluates the correctness and robustness  
of candidate patches generated by the Patch Generation Agent.  
For verified bugs, each candidate patch is validated by executing both the reproduction test  
and a selected set of regression tests. Candidate regression tests are first retrieved by the Context  
Retrieval Engine based on their semantic relevance to the modified code regions. An LLM then  
selects a focused subset of these tests that are most likely to be impacted by the patch and thus  
informative for validation. A patch is immediately accepted as the final fix once it passes both the  
reproduction test and all selected regression tests. Otherwise, the patch is discarded, and control is  
returned to the Patch Generation Agent. This generate–verify loop continues until a valid patch is  
found or the iteration budget is exhausted.  
For unverified bugs as well as feature or refactoring issues, the agent relies solely on selected  
regression tests for validation. All patches that pass regression testing are collected into a verified  
patch pool, which is subsequently normalized and deduplicated to remove semantically equivalent  
candidates. Normalization canonicalizes patch representations (e.g., formatting and edit ordering),  
while deduplication is approximated using structural similarity of code edits. From the remaining  
candidates, the most suitable patch is selected via an LLM-based aggregation mechanism and  
majority voting. This design follows prior work such as TRAE \[ 11 \] and Agentless \[ 39 \], which  
employ multi-patch generation and aggregation when executable verification is unavailable. If no  
patch passes verification, the same aggregation mechanism is applied over all generated candidates  
to ensure graceful degradation and the return of a plausible solution.

\- RQ1 (Effectiveness Comparison): How effectively does Prometheus resolve issues compared  
    to related code agents?  
\- RQ2 (Analysis of Context Retrieval): What’s the quality of Prometheus’s context retrieval

\`\`\`  
3.2 Experimental Setup  
Prometheus is implemented in Python, and uses GPT-5 (temperature 1.0) for generation and  
reasoning, andcodestral-embed-2505for subquery embedding in working memory. Experiments  
are conducted on an Ubuntu 24.04 server with 32 CPU cores (Intel Xeon E5-2667 v4), 125 GiB RAM.

We utilize Neo4j for Knowledge Graph storage and PostgreSQL for working memory. For context  
retrieval, AST nodes are chunked at traversal depth 1, while documentation uses 5,000-token  
chunks (500-token overlap). The working memory module filters context using a 0.85 similarity  
threshold, retaining the top-5 entries. We generate up to 5 candidate patches per issue, all evaluated  
in a uniform environment to ensure reproducibility. Both Bug Reproduction and Patch Verification  
Agents operate within isolated Docker containers to ensure environment consistency and security.  
For the web search tool, the agent integrates Tavily \[ 1 \] as its web search tool to obtain up-to-date  
documentation and repository-related knowledge when required.

3.2.1 Benchmarks. We evaluate Prometheus through a series of comprehensive experiments  
designed to assess its efficacy, stability, and generalization capabilities in automated software  
engineering. As shown in Table 1, our evaluation centers on two primary benchmarks: SWE-bench  
Verified \[ 17 \], a human-curated subset of 500 instances from the original SWE-bench characterized  
by high-quality problem statements and reliable unit tests for Python-based issue resolution, and  
SWE-PolyBench Verified \[ 30 \], a multi-language benchmark of 382 instances that extends evaluation  
beyond bug fixing to include feature implementation and refactoring across 3 additional languages,  
such as Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Both benchmarks provide only the issue description and  
the full repository, without explicit fault localization or additional oracle information. Together,  
these benchmarks enable a robust assessment of the agent’s generality and its ability to adapt to  
heterogeneous, real-world codebases. Systems are therefore required to reason over repository-level  
context, reflecting realistic software maintenance settings.

\`\`\`  
3.2.2 Methodology.  
\`\`\`  
Effectiveness Comparison (RQ1). To evaluate the effectiveness of Prometheus, we evaluate it on  
two real-world software engineering benchmarks: SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \] and SWE-PolyBench  
Verified \[30\].  
We compare Prometheus with several strong baselines reported in prior work and public  
leaderboards, namely OpenHands \[ 38 \] Agentless \[ 39 \], live-SWE-agent \[ 40 \], and SWE-agent \[ 44 \]  
on SWE-bench Verified, and Amazon Q Developer Agent \[ 3 \], Aider \[ 2 \], SWE-agent \[ 44 \], and  
Agentless \[ 39 \] on SWE-Polybench. We do not reimplement any baseline systems; instead, we  
directly adopt results reported in the corresponding papers or official benchmark leaderboards. We  
report the percentage of resolved issues as the primary evaluation metric to assess the effectiveness  
of Prometheus under identical benchmark definitions.

Analysis of Context Retrieval (RQ2). To analyze how the context retrieval mechanism of Prometheus  
differs from existing agents, we conduct a trajectory-based comparative analysis focusing on the  
quality of retrieved context rather than end-to-end task success.  
We randomly select 100 instances from SWE-bench Verified due to limited resources, and we run  
these instances using GPT-5 on Prometheus, Agentless \[ 39 \], OpenHands \[ 38 \], and SWE-agent \[ 44 \].  
We selected these agents because they are open-sourced and well-maintained. For each instance, we

use the gold patch provided by the benchmark to construct a gold context. Starting from the files  
and code regions modified in the gold patch, we engage six professional developers to manually  
trace the relevant functions and dependency-related code required to understand and implement  
the fix, yielding a minimal gold context that generates a valid patch. For each agent, we extract all  
contextual artifacts retrieved throughout its execution trajectory, including files, functions, and  
code spans accessed via search, ranking, or navigation actions, and aggregate them to form the  
agent-retrieved context. We then compare the agent-retrieved context against the corresponding  
gold context to assess context retrieval accuracy and characterize retrieval behavior across agents.  
\`\`\`  
Ablation Study of Core Components (RQ3). We consider four core components: working memory,  
multiple patch selection, bug reproduction agent, and regression testing. Starting from the full  
Prometheus configuration, we create ablated variants by disabling each component independently,  
while keeping all other components, model backbones, prompts, and execution settings unchanged.  
This controlled setup allows us to isolate the impact of each component on overall system behavior.  
Each ablated variant is evaluated under the same benchmark protocols as the full system. We  
measure issue resolution performance using the percentage of resolved issues. By comparing  
the ablated variants against the full configuration, we quantify how the absence of individual  
components affects both effectiveness and reliability in repository-level issue resolution.

\`\`\`  
4 Experimental Results  
4.1 RQ1: Effectiveness Comparison  
\`\`\`  
As shown in Table 2 and Table 3, we compare Prometheus against a diverse set of representative  
agents on two widely used benchmarks: SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \] and SWE-PolyBench Verified \[ 30 \].  
SWE-bench Verified focuses on single-language, execution-verified bug-fixing tasks, while SWE-  
PolyBench evaluates robustness in a more challenging multi-language and multi-task setting.  
Together, these benchmarks provide a comprehensive view of effectiveness and generalization.  
On SWE-bench Verified, Prometheus achieves a resolution rate of 74.4%, placing it among  
the top-performing systems. It outperforms a wide range of strong baselines, including fully  
autonomous agents such as OpenHands \[ 38 \] with GPT-5 (71.8%) and SWE-agent \[ 44 \] with Claude  
4 Sonnet (66.6%), as well as recent competitive systems such as Lingxi v1.5 \[ 45 \] \+ Kimi K2 (71.2%).  
Prometheus also consistently surpasses lighter-weight or search-based approaches, including  
Agentless-1.5 \[ 39 \] (50.8%) and multiple mini-SWE-agent variants using Gemini 2.5 Pro (53.6%),  
DeepSeek V3.2 Reasoner (60.0%), and GPT-5 (65.0%). These results indicate that the performance

gains of Prometheus cannot be attributed solely to model choice, but rather stem from its system-  
level design.  
We further compare the sets of unique resolved instances across Prometheus, OpenHands, and  
mini-SWE-agent using the same GPT-5 model. Prometheus resolves the largest number of unique  
instances (29), followed by OpenHands (16) and mini-SWE-agent (4). The larger unique region  
associated with Prometheus indicates that its performance gains stem not only from common  
cases, but also from resolving harder issues. We attribute this advantage to its repository-level  
Knowledge Graph and Memory Enhanced Context Retrieval Engine, which supports more reliable  
long-horizon reasoning.  
As shown in Table 3, Prometheus attains an overall resolution rate of 33.8% on SWE-PolyBench  
Verified, ranking first on this more challenging benchmark. It outperforms other strong baselines,  
including Amazon Q Developer Agent \[ 3 \] (28.8%), and more than doubles the performance of widely  
used tools such as Aider-PB \[ 2 \] with Sonnet 3.5 (16.2%). In particular, Prometheus substantially  
surpasses SWE-agent-PB \[ 44 \] (14.4%) and AgentlessPB \[ 39 \] (13.3%), demonstrating stronger robustness  
in multi-language and multi-task settings. Task-wise analysis further shows that Prometheus  
performs best on bug-fixing tasks (37.5%), while also achieving strong results on refactoring (30.8%)  
and maintaining competitive performance on feature implementation tasks (18.6%). To the best  
of our knowledge, Prometheus is the first work to report task-wise resolution rates on SWE-  
Polybench.  
Overall, these results show that Prometheus goes beyond patch generation, exhibiting strong  
capabilities in long-horizon issue resolution and repository-level understanding. By integrating  
repository-level Knowledge Graph with a Memory Enhanced Context Retrieval Engine, Prometheus  
resolves a broader range of issues, including many unsolved by prior agent frameworks. This marks  
a clear shift from patch-centric repair toward holistic, program-level reasoning, bringing automated  
program repair closer to practical, real-world applicability.

\`\`\`  
Answer to RQ1: Prometheus achieves the highest resolution rates on both benchmarks and  
resolves the most unique instances. This advantage extends to harder and multi-language issues,  
indicating stronger generalization than prior agents. These results highlight the effectiveness of  
repository-level knowledge and memory-enhanced retrieval.

\`\`\`  
4.2 RQ2: Analysis of Context Retrieval  
\`\`\`  
We conduct a qualitative analysis of context retrieval quality for representative top-performing  
agents on SWE-bench \[ 17 \], examining their ability to retrieve relevant context at multiple level. As  
shown in Table 4, Prometheus consistently outperforms all baselines across file-, symbol-, and  
span-level hit rates, indicating a substantially stronger alignment between retrieved context and  
the gold patch evidence.  
At the file level, Prometheus achieves a hit rate of 0.915, surpassing OpenHands (0.876) and  
Agentless (0.802), suggesting that it more reliably identifies the set of files relevant to the underlying  
issue. This advantage becomes more pronounced at finer granularities. At the symbol level,  
Prometheus attains a hit rate of 0.850, representing a large margin over all baselines, which  
remain below 0.58. This result indicates that Prometheus is markedly more effective at recovering  
semantically relevant functions, classes, and variables, rather than relying primarily on coarse  
file-level context. The gap widens further at the span level, where Prometheus reaches a hit rate of  
0.807, substantially outperforming OpenHands (0.541), SWE-Agent (0.482), and especially Agentless  
(0.054). This demonstrates Prometheus ’s superior ability to localize fine-grained code regions  
that directly correspond to the modifications made in the gold patches. Such fine-grained retrieval  
is critical for downstream patch generation, as precise localization of relevant code spans provides  
stronger and less ambiguous evidence for reasoning about bug causes and fixes.  
Overall, these results highlight that Prometheus ’s retrieval mechanism is not only broader  
in coverage but also more structurally precise across multiple levels of granularity. By effectively  
bridging file-level discovery and span-level localization, Prometheus enables a more comprehensive  
and actionable understanding of the program context, which is essential for reliable long-horizon  
issue resolution compared to prior agent-based approaches.

\`\`\`  
Answer to RQ2: Prometheus consistently retrieves more accurate context across file, symbol,  
and span levels than prior agents. Its advantage is especially pronounced at fine-grained symbol  
and span levels, indicating superior localization of patch-relevant code. This precise retrieval  
provides stronger evidence for downstream reasoning and patch generation.  
\`\`\`  
4.3 RQ3: Ablation Study of Core Components  
4.3.1 Ablation Study on Working Memory. To evaluate the efficiency of the working memory  
mechanism, we have done an ablation study by removing it. Our results show that incorporating  
working memory substantially improves both efficiency and performance. Due to limited resources,  
we randomly select 50 instances from SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \] and run them in both configurations.  
As summarized in Figure 7, Prometheus with working memory achieves a resolution rate of  
70.00% while incurring a total inference cost of $200.79 across 50 issues. In contrast, the variant  
without working memory resolves only 56.00% of issues and incurs a significantly higher cost of  
$367.73. This demonstrates that working memory yields significant resource savings, reducing

\`\`\`  
Prometheus 1:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Fig. 7\. Ablation study on working memory.  
\`\`\`  
inference cost by approximately 45.4%↓, while simultaneously improving the issue resolution  
rate by 25.0%↑. This demonstrates that working memory effectively reduces redundant context  
retrieval and excessive token consumption, while stabilizing long-horizon reasoning by preserving  
query-relevant context across iterative repair steps. Without working memory, repeated retrieval  
and short-horizon context not only increases inference cost but also degrades decision quality.  
Case Study: Impact of Working Memory on Retrieval Efficiency. We present a representative  
case from SWE-bench Verified to illustrate how working memory improves retrieval efficiency  
and stabilizes long-horizon reasoning. The issue requests setting a default value ofFILE\_UPLOAD  
\_PERMISSIONSto0o644, motivated by inconsistent file permissions caused by different upload  
handlers and temporary file backends.  
In the configuration without working memory, the agent repeatedly retrieved the same core  
files across multiple iterations, includingdjango/core/files/storage.py,django/core/files  
/uploadhandler.py, anddjango/core/files/uploadedfile.py. Because previously retrieved  
context was not preserved, each reasoning step re-triggered similar repository-level searches and  
re-encoding of identical code regions. As the agent attempted to reconcile interactions between  
upload handlers, temporary file creation, and final storage semantics, this repeated retrieval caused  
substantial token overhead and context redundancy. Moreover, the lack of persistent memory  
led to fragmented reasoning about the permission propagation path, resulting in unstable patch  
exploration and significantly increased inference cost.  
When working memory is enabled, the same files are retrieved once and stored as query-relevant  
context. Subsequent reasoning steps directly reuse these memory entries rather than re-fetching  
identical code from the repository. This allows the agent to maintain a coherent view of how upload  
handlers, temporary files, and storage backends jointly affect file permissions. In addition, related  
contextual information—such as where permissions are ultimately applied during file saving—is  
retained across iterations, enabling more focused retrieval of only genuinely new context. As a  
result, the agent converges more quickly to a consistent solution while substantially reducing  
redundant token consumption.

\`\`\`  
4.3.2 Ablation Study on Multiple Patch Selection. To evaluate the contribution of multiple patch  
selection, we conduct an ablation experiment by disabling this component. We evaluate this variant  
on all 500 instances from SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \]. As a result, the overall resolution rate score  
drops from 74.4 for the full system to 69.2 without multiple patch selection, corresponding to a  
degradation of 7.0%↓. The results highlight the importance of multi-patch selection. This approach

allows the system to evaluate diverse candidates, preventing it from settling on an incorrect solution.  
These results suggest that aggregating and selecting among multiple candidate patches substantially  
enhances robustness and reliability in agentic issue resolution.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
4.3.3 Ablation Study on Bug Reproduction. To assess the impact of the Bug Reproduction Agent, we  
perform an ablation study by disabling the reproduction test. We evaluate this variant on the full  
SWE-bench Verified benchmark. The resolution rate score decreases from 74.4 with the full system  
to 64.0 without bug reproduction, representing a substantial drop of 14.0%↓. This substantial drop  
highlights the importance of explicitly reproducing reported bugs, as reproduction tests provide  
a strong execution-based signal for verifying whether a candidate patch truly addresses the root  
cause of the issue. Without this signal, the system is more prone to accepting patches that pass  
partial validation but fail to resolve the original bug, leading to reduced effectiveness and reliability.  
\`\`\`  
4.3.4 Ablation Study on Regression Testing. To examine the role of regression testing component,  
we conduct an ablation study by removing this component from Prometheus and evaluating  
candidate patches without executing additional regression tests beyond bug reproduction. We  
evaluate this variant on the full SWE-bench Verified benchmark. The resolution rate score decreases  
from 74.4 with the full system to 70.2 without regression testing, corresponding to a reduction  
of 5.6%↓. This result demonstrates that regression tests provide an important complementary  
verification signal, helping to detect patches that fix the target bug but inadvertently break existing  
functionality. Removing regression testing increases the risk of accepting overfitted or brittle  
patches, leading to reduced overall reliability despite a smaller performance drop compared to  
removing bug reproduction.

\`\`\`  
Answer to RQ3: Removing any core component leads to a clear performance drop, with  
bug reproduction having the largest impact. Multiple patch selection and regression testing  
further improve robustness by preventing premature or overfitted patches. Working memory  
significantly reduces cost while improving resolution, highlighting its role in long-horizon  
reasoning.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5 Related Work  
5.1 Agentic Issue Resolution  
The field of software maintenance is transitioning from traditional Automated Program Repair  
(APR) toward comprehensive agentic issue resolution. Historically, APR focused on generating  
patches for localized bugs, relying on predefined patterns \[ 22 \] or heuristics \[ 19 , 46 \] validated against  
functional-level test oracles \[ 49 \]. While effective for well-scoped bugs, these methods struggle with  
the complexity of repository-level issues. Recent advancements in LLMs have catalyzed a shift  
toward autonomous code agents capable of long-horizon reasoning across multiple components  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
Prometheus 1:  
\`\`\`  
\[ 17 , 41 \]. Existing coding agents can be categorized into two primary paradigms based on their  
orchestration: fully-autonomous agents and workflow-based agents.  
Fully-autonomous Agent. This paradigm utilizes LLMs to dynamically determine execution  
workflows, allowing for flexible tool invocation based on the evolving context of a task. SWE-  
Agent \[ 44 \] is a pioneer in this category, introducing the Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to facilitate  
more effective interaction between the agent and the software environment. OpenHands \[ 38 \]  
builds upon the foundation of an ACI similar to SWE-Agent. ClaudeCode \[ 4 \] further pushes the  
boundaries of agency by integrating deep reasoning with a CLI-based execution loop for real-time,  
autonomous repository maintenance. Codex \[ 26 \] represents a significant milestone, demonstrating  
sophisticated autonomous problem-solving capabilities across large-scale codebases. Expanding  
this autonomy further, Live-SWE-Agent \[ 40 \] introduces a self-evolving paradigm that allows the  
agent to autonomously and continuously refine its own scaffold implementation on-the-fly during  
runtime. By evolving from basic tools to complex scaffolds without offline training, it has achieved  
state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as SWE-bench Verified \[ 17 \]. While highly flexible,  
these fully autonomous agent systems often struggle with non-deterministic execution paths and  
significant computational overhead.  
Workflow-based Agent. Workflow-based (or pipeline-based) agents follow a predefined, human-  
designed workflow to ensure stability, efficiency, and reproducibility. Agentless \[ 39 \] is a representative  
method that intentionally avoids complex agentic loops, instead following a strict "localization-  
generation-validation" sequence. AutoCodeRover \[ 53 \] and SpecRover \[ 32 \] enhance this process  
by combining spectrum-based fault localization with LLM-guided code search within a structured  
pipeline. TRAE \[ 11 \] and Lingxi \[ 45 \] also adopt this paradigm, utilizing more sophisticated but fixed  
orchestration layers to manage large-scale repository edits. By constraining the agent’s action space  
to a structured execution graph, these workflow-based systems mitigate the risks of "hallucinated"  
workflows and significantly reduce the search space for software patches.  
Despite their success, existing coding agents—from fully-autonomous loops to workflow-based  
pipelines—frequently encounter a "retrieval bottleneck" in large codebases due to a lack of structured  
memory and iterative refinement. Unlike prior works that rely on one-off tool invocations, Prometheus  
utilizes a special context retrieval mechanism integrated with a multi-vector working memory. By  
transitioning from static search to iterative, memory-augmented traversal, our approach ensures  
precise evidence collection across complex repository structures.

\`\`\`  
5.2 Repository-level Context Retrieval  
Effective issue resolution in real-world software repositories often requires coherent, repository-  
level context, as bugs frequently span multiple files, cross-file dependencies, and multi-layer  
abstractions. To address this challenge, recent work has explored repository-level context retrieval as  
a core primitive for downstream tasks such as code completion, understanding, and repair. Focusing  
on efficiency, REPOFUSE \[ 20 \] retrieves analogy- and rationale-based context while optimizing  
for latency and token usage. Similarly, RepoCoder \[ 51 \] leverages iterative retrieval to capture  
semantically related code chunks across the repository. Beyond raw code, DocPrompting \[ 54 \]  
retrieves documentation-relevant snippets via embedding-based techniques, while LTFix \[ 10 \]  
targets memory errors in C codebases by retrieving typestate-guided usage traces.  
To capture the structural complexity of codebases, recent research has turned to Knowledge  
Graphs. RepoGraph \[ 27 \] models code entities and their interactions as graphs, while KGCompass \[ 43 \]  
further links code with repository artifacts such as issues and pull requests to enable path-based  
reasoning. In contrast, Code Graph Model \[ 35 \] embeds repository-level code graphs directly into  
LLMs to support joint semantic and structural reasoning. By formalizing repositories as structured

\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
semantic networks, knowledge graph-based methods provide a coherent architectural map that  
improves contextual integrity for downstream tasks.  
Prometheus features a language-agnostic graph model for repository-scale retrieval across  
diverse tasks. While agents such as OpenHands \[ 38 \] are efficient executors, they often lack deep  
contextual reasoning for long-horizon issues. In contrast, Prometheus incorporates a working  
memory mechanism to persistently maintain and selectively update salient context during issue  
resolution, reducing redundant retrieval and repeated reasoning while improving logical consistency  
and computational efficiency.  
\`\`\`  
5.3 Memory for Agents  
Recent agent-based systems increasingly incorporate explicit memory mechanisms to support long-  
horizon reasoning, contextual consistency, and continual improvement, moving beyond treating  
memory as a transient by-product of the context window.  
MemGPT \[ 28 \] introduces an OS-inspired memory hierarchy that separates a limited working  
context from persistent external storage, enabling agents to retain long-term factual information  
through explicit read and write operations. Voyager \[ 37 \] accumulates reusable skills distilled  
from successful task trajectories, allowing agents to progressively expand procedural capabilities  
without retraining. While these memory mechanisms are primarily studied in agents with other  
purposes or tasks, similar ideas have recently been adapted to software issue resolution, where  
agents must reason over large codebases and maintain evolving repair context across multiple steps.  
EXPEREPAIR \[ 24 \] and SWE-Exp \[ 8 \] explicitly model cross-issue repair experience by distilling  
reusable repair demonstrations and abstracted problem-solving insights from prior issue-resolution  
trajectories, which are dynamically retrieved to guide future repository-level fixes. RepairAgent \[ 7 \]  
maintains a dynamically updated interaction state within a single repair episode, preserving  
gathered code context, hypotheses, and tool outputs to support iterative decision making, but does  
not persist experience across issues.  
In contrast to these approaches, Prometheus adopts a system-oriented working memory design  
tailored to software repositories. Rather than maintaining issue-local interaction traces or retrieving  
past trajectories, its working memory explicitly organizes and updates query-relevant repository  
artifacts (e.g., files, functions, and tests) and evolving repair states across iterative steps, enabling  
semantically grounded context management for long-horizon software engineering tasks.

Internal Validity. A potential internal threat lies in whether the observed improvements truly  
result from the proposed memory mechanism rather than random factors or implementation  
variance. Due to the high computational and API costs of running LLM-based agents, we conduct  
each experiment once under strictly controlled settings, using fixed random seeds, identical prompts,  
and consistent tool configurations across all baselines. Although this limitation prevents repeated  
trials, the performance differences between Prometheus and prior agents are substantial and  
consistent across tasks, suggesting that the observed trends are robust.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
External Validity. External validity threats concern the generalizability of our findings to other  
repositories, programming languages, and LLM backbones. To mitigate this threat, we evaluate  
Prometheus on two representative issue resolution benchmarks, SWE-bench Verified and SWE-  
PolyBench Verified, where the latter covers multiple programming languages and diverse repository  
structures. Although these benchmarks may not fully capture the scale and complexity of real-world  
industrial systems, the consistent performance of Prometheus across both datasets and multiple  
programming languages suggests that the findings generalize well, thereby alleviating this threat.

\`\`\`  
Construct Validity. Construct validity concerns whether our evaluation metrics accurately reflect  
the capability of long-horizon codebase navigation. We measure issue resolution accuracy using  
standardized success criteria defined in SWE-bench and SWE-PolyBench, and further assess context  
retrieval precision against human-annotated gold contexts to capture the quality of contextual  
reasoning. Although these metrics may not fully represent all qualitative aspects of real-world  
software development, their consistency across both task-level and retrieval-level evaluations  
provides mutual validation, mitigating this threat.

7 Conclusion  
\`\`\`  
We presented Prometheus, a multi-agent system that shifts the focus of automated software issue  
resolution from local patch generation to long-horizon, repository-level software engineering.  
By integrating repository-level knowledge graphs with a memory-enhanced retrieval engine,  
Prometheus enables deep program understanding and iterative reasoning across complex codebases.  
Through the coordination of specialized agents for retrieval, generation, and verification, the  
system effectively unifies structural dependencies, historical context, and execution feedback. Our  
evaluations on SWE-bench Verified and SWE-PolyBench Verified demonstrate that Prometheus  
significantly outperforms existing baselines, particularly in challenging multi-language and multi-  
task scenarios. These results underscore that robust automated maintenance requires principled  
mechanisms for long-horizon reasoning and repository-level abstraction beyond simple code  
generation. Prometheus represents a critical step toward practical, reliable software agents that  
align with real-world development workflows.
