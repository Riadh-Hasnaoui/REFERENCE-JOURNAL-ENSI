\#\#\# Abstract

Code completion, a crucial practice in industrial settings, helps de-  
velopers improve programming efficiency by automatically suggest-  
ing code snippets during development. With the emergence of Large  
Code Models (LCMs), this field has witnessed significant advance-  
ments. Due to the natural differences between open-source and  
industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique internal  
dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct do-  
main adaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist mul-  
tiple adaptation approaches, among which retrieval-augmented gen-  
eration (RAG) and fine-tuning are the two most popular paradigms.  
However, no prior research has explored the trade-off of the two  
approaches in industrial scenarios.  
To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms  
including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning  
(FT), for industrial code completion in this paper. In collaboration  
with Tencent’s WXG department, we collect over 160,000 inter-  
nal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the two types of  
adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned  
by industrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and  
parameter sensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that  
RAG, when implemented with appropriate embedding models that  
map code snippets into dense vector representations, can achieve  
higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone. Specifically, BM25 presents  
superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency among studied RAG  
methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and their  
combination leads to further improvement. We also observe that

\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 1 Introduction

\`\`\`  
Code completion stands as a fundamental and critical task in code  
intelligence, aiming to predict subsequent code tokens or state-  
ments that developers intend to write. By anticipating developers’  
coding intentions, code completion remarkably enhances program-  
ming productivity and has become an indispensable feature in  
modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) \[ 5 \]. The  
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) \[ 2 \] has led to the emer-  
gence of Large Code Models (LCMs) \[ 16 , 18 \], which bring sub-  
stantial improvements to code completion performance \[ 18 \]. This  
advancement has catalyzed the development of multiple commer-  
cial tools \[5,6\], offering personalized code completion services.  
Despite LCMs’ impressive performance in general development  
scenarios such as utility scripts and application development, their  
effectiveness substantially deteriorates when applied to industrial  
proprietary codebases \[ 1 \]. This performance gap arises from the  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
FSE Companion ’25, June 23–28, 2025, Trondheim, Norway Wang et al.  
\`\`\`  
inherent complexity and massive scale of industrial code, which  
often undergoes extensive business-specific implementation. For  
instance, our industrial partner Tencent WXG operates WeChat,  
China’s largest instant messaging platform with over one billion  
monthly active users. Beyond basic communication services, the  
platform supports a rich ecosystem of features including social  
networking (Moments) and short-form videos. To accommodate  
this massive user base and diverse functionality demands, WXG has  
developed an extensive and sophisticated backend infrastructure  
with unique architectural patterns and optimizations. These spe-  
cialized implementations significantly deviate from conventional  
open-source solutions, creating a substantial distributional shift  
between industrial code patterns and the open-source training data  
used by LCMs. Moreover, the sensitive nature of proprietary code  
and associated privacy concerns preclude the direct utilization of  
commercial code completion solutions, even those with superior  
capabilities, necessitating alternative approaches for industrial code  
completion.  
Given the distribution gap between industrial and open-source  
codebase, two predominant approaches have emerged to adapt  
LCMs to new domains: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) \[ 38 ,  
65 \] and fine-tuning (FT) \[ 27 , 63 \]. Specifically, given a novel source  
code repository previously unseen by the model, RAG enhances  
generation by retrieving relative code snippets from the repository  
as prior knowledge. This retrieval-based augmentation manifests  
in two forms: (1) prompt-based augmentation \[ 72 \], where retrieved  
similar code segments are prepended to the input query, providing  
contextual examples; and (2) logits-based augmentation \[ 24 , 56 \],  
where the distribution of similar usage patterns and outputs serves  
as a prior to calibrate the model’s prediction distribution. In con-  
trast, FT directly optimizes the model’s parameters on the target  
codebase, aiming at aligning the model’s internal distribution with  
the domain-specific patterns present in industrial repositories.  
While both RAG and FT approaches have demonstrated effec-  
tiveness across diverse domains, such as document QA and code  
intelligence \[ 27 , 38 , 64 , 65 \], these studies predominantly focus  
on public datasets containing general knowledge. Industrial code-  
bases present unique challenges with their complex dependencies,  
company-specific patterns, and proprietary frameworks, making  
the direct application of existing findings uncertain. The efficacy  
of these approaches in such specialized, real-world environments  
remains largely unexplored. Existing RAG-based code completion  
research \[ 35 , 66 \] has primarily focused on Python and Java code-  
bases, where implementations tend to be more concise and less  
intricate than C++ systems which are widely used in Tencent WXG  
\[ 49 , 70 \]. Moreover, these studies have been conducted on relatively  
small-scale open-source repositories, making their findings poten-  
tially less applicable to industrial environments. The massive scale  
of industrial codebases significantly increases retrieval complexity,  
as the search space expands exponentially and the identification  
of relevant code snippets becomes more challenging. For instance,  
logits-based retrieval methods \[ 56 , 74 \] provide feasible and effective  
solutions for small codebases. However, they become prohibitively  
expensive when scaling to industrial repositories with hundreds of  
thousands of files, as they require storing and searching through  
massive logit matrices for each code segment. These distinctive

\`\`\`  
characteristics of industrial codebases necessitate a thorough inves-  
tigation of existing adaptation approaches tailored to these specific  
challenges.  
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study com-  
paring RAG and FT approaches for adapting LLMs to industrial  
code completion tasks. We use the backend codebase with more  
than 160,000 files of Tencent WXG as our experimental testbed,  
which contains various business functionalities and represents the  
complexity typical of industrial software systems. To systemati-  
cally investigate adaptation approaches, we construct a subset of  
120,000 C++ files as both the retrieval corpus for RAG and the train-  
ing data for FT experiments. For the RAG approaches, we explore  
two main categories: (1) similarity-based retrieval \[ 74 \], which iden-  
tifies syntactically or semantically similar code snippets, and (2)  
dependency-based retrieval \[ 36 \], which leverages project-specific  
dependency relationships and usage patterns. Our evaluation com-  
prehensively compares these RAG variants against FT approaches  
across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, efficiency, and  
parameter sensitivity.  
Through extensive experiments, our study reveals several key  
findings in enhancing LCM-based industrial code completion. RAG  
and FT substantially improve LCMs’ performance, with RAG achiev-  
ing a higher performance ceiling. Notably, among the evaluated  
RAG approaches, BM25 demonstrates superior effectiveness while  
maintaining computational efficiency comparing with neural em-  
bedding models. The combination of RAG and FT yields further  
performance gains, suggesting their complementary nature. Regard-  
ing computational costs, FT primarily requires resources during the  
preparation stage for model training, while RAG’s overhead mainly  
occurs during inference as it needs to retrieve and process rele-  
vant code snippets in runtime. Furthermore, we observe that RAG  
demonstrates better scalability than FT, showing more sustained  
performance gains with larger scales of codebase.  
Our key contributions are summarized as follows:  
\`\`\`  
\- We present the first comprehensive study of LCM adaptation  
    approaches on a large-scale proprietary industrial codebase.  
    Our evaluation reveals the performance limitations of cur-  
    rent state-of-the-art LCMs when directly applied to indus-  
    trial code completion tasks, highlighting the necessity for  
    more effective domain adaptation.  
\- We conduct extensive experiments comparing RAG and FT  
    approaches across multiple dimensions, including effective-  
    ness, efficiency, and data scaling. This systematic evaluation  
    provides a detailed understanding of the trade-offs between  
    different adaptation approaches in industrial settings.  
\- We derive practical insights and guidelines for developers  
    seeking to adapt LCMs for code completion in proprietary  
    codebases, offering empirically validated recommendations  
    for implementing appropriate adaptation approaches.

\#\#\# 2 Research Methodology

\#\#\# 2.1 Data Preparation

\`\`\`  
2.1.1 Data Collection and Filtering.We collect a comprehensive  
snapshot of our backend C++ codebase from our department’s  
repository. To ensure data quality and minimize potential training  
artifacts, we apply the following filtering criteria:

\- Remove duplicate files and auto-generated framework code  
    (i.e., compilation files) to prevent over-fitting of templated  
    patterns  
\- Filter out files containing extensive Chinese comments to  
    maintain consistency in the training corpus  
\- Eliminate files with unusually long C++ definitions (\# define),  
    as these rare patterns could potentially lead to catastrophic  
    repetition in model outputs.  
After applying these filtering rules, we obtained a final dataset of  
163,746 valid C++ source files. We further processed these files using  
ClangD \[ 4 \] to standardize code formatting, including consistent  
indentation and line break rules.

2.1.2 Dataset Splitting.To create a robust evaluation benchmark,  
we select 20,000 C++ files from our filtered dataset for generating  
input-output pairs. We employ a sliding window approach, where  
each input consists of 20 consecutive lines of code, and the target  
is the subsequent line. To ensure meaningful evaluation metrics,  
we apply additional filtering criteria to the target lines: (1) exclude  
instances where the target line contains only a single symbol, and  
(2) remove cases where the target line consists solely of comments.  
After this process, we randomly sample 50,000 high-quality test  
instances, which form our evaluation benchmark for assessing  
model performance. The resulting test set covers various code com-  
pletion scenarios while maintaining practical relevance to real-  
world development tasks.  
For the remaining 143,746 source code files, we randomly select  
120,000 for building retrieval database and fine-tuning LCMs, and  
23,746 for validation. The statistics are shown in Table1.

\#\#\# 2.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation

\`\`\`  
2.2.1 Retrieval Database Construction.Direct utilization of our  
120,000 C++ files for retrieval presents significant challenges. First,  
using entire C++ files as retrieval units is impractical due to their  
substantial length, with our codebase averaging over 3,300 tokens  
per file. Second, files often contain extraneous information that  
could potentially interfere with the model’s inference process.  
To address these limitations, we decompose the files into fine-  
grained retrieval units. Specifically, we employ the Tree-Sitter \[ 58 \]  
to decompose each file into more granular units, specifically ex-  
tracting individual functions and classes. We treat C++ files that  
either lack function definitions or contain only function declara-  
tions as single retrieval units. This decomposition strategy results  
in a final retrieval database of 914,667 items, providing a more fo-  
cused and manageable collection of code segments. Specifically, we  
explore two kinds of RAG methods for code completion including  
similarity-based and dependency-based retrieval.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
2.2.2 Similarity-Based Retrieval.Given our retrieval database𝐷  
containing 914,667 items, we implement a similarity-based retrieval  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
mechanism. LetMdenote the embedding model. For each item  
𝑑𝑖 ∈𝐷, we compute its embedding vectorv𝑖=M(𝑑𝑖). These  
embeddings form our vector database𝑉 \=v 1 ,v 2 , ...,v𝑛. During  
inference, for a given query𝑞, we compute its embeddingq=M(𝑞).  
The similarity score between the query and each item in the  
database is calculated using cosine similarity: sim(𝑞,𝑑𝑖)=|qq||·vv𝑖𝑖|.  
We select the top-𝐾items with highest similarity scores:𝑑( 1 ),  
𝑑( 2 ),...,𝑑(𝐾), where(𝑖)denotes the index of the𝑖-th most similar  
item. Following the work \[ 12 \], these𝐾items are concatenated  
in ascending order of similarity and prepended to the query as  
examples. The augmented prompt is then fed to the model for  
generation:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
prompt=𝑑(𝐾)⊕𝑑(𝐾− 1 )⊕...⊕𝑑( 1 )⊕𝑞 (1)  
where⊕denotes concatenation.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
2.2.3 Dependency-Based Retrieval.Besides similarity-based retrieval,  
we also explore a dependency-based retrieval method that lever-  
ages function call relationships to provide relevant context for code  
completion. Given a code completion query𝑞, we first extract a  
sequence of function calls𝐶=\[𝑐 1 ,𝑐 2 , ...,𝑐𝑚\]using Tree-sitter \[ 58 \],  
a robust parsing framework. For each function call𝑐𝑖, we locate  
its corresponding function definition𝑑𝑖in the retrieval codebase,  
resulting in a sequence of function definitions𝐷=\[𝑑 1 ,𝑑 2 , ...,𝑑𝑚\].  
The retrieved function definitions are then concatenated and  
prepended to the original query𝑞to form the augmented prompt:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
prompt=𝑑𝑚⊕𝑑𝑚− 1 ⊕...⊕𝑑 1 ⊕𝑞 (2)  
This approach ensures that the model has access to the implemen-  
tation details of the functions being called in the query, providing  
context for more accurate code completion. By explicitly including  
function definitions, the model can better understand the expected  
behavior and usage patterns of the called functions.  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 2.3 Fine-Tuning

\`\`\`  
For the fine-tuning approach, we conduct training at the file level  
using source code. Following previous work \[ 10 , 63 , 69 \], we first  
tokenize and concatenate the code text into a continuous sequence  
of tokens𝑡 1 ,𝑡 2 , ...,𝑡𝑛. Given a context length𝐿, we segment the  
token sequence into non-overlapping blocks:  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\#\#\# (𝑡 1 , ...,𝑡𝐿),(𝑡𝐿+ 1 , ...,𝑡 2 𝐿), ...,(𝑡𝑛−𝐿+ 1 , ...,𝑡𝑛) (3)

\`\`\`  
The model is then trained in an autoregressive manner to predict  
the next token given all previous tokens in the sequence:

\#\#\# 3 Experimental Setup

\#\#\# 3.1 Selected LCMs

In this paper, we select two kinds of popular and state-of-the-art  
LCMs with their versions in different sizes. In specific, our selected  
LCMs are:

\- DeepSeek-Coder(DSC) \[ 16 \] is trained from 2T tokens from  
    scratch, achieving state-of-the-art performance in a variety  
    of code intelligence tasks. Specifically, we choose DeepSeek-  
    Coder Base in sizes of 1.3B and 6.7B in this paper.  
\- Qwen2.5-Coder(QC) \[ 18 \] is a family of LCMs based on  
    models of the Qwen2.5 series \[ 73 \]. Qwen2.5 undergoes four-  
    stage training with a total number of 5.5T tokens, presenting  
    state-of-the-art performance in both code generation and  
    reasoning. We choose 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, and 7B versions of  
    Qwen2.5-Coder.

\#\#\# 3.2 Evaluation Metrics

Following previous work \[ 40 , 45 , 59 \], we select accuracy, edit sim-  
ilarity, and BLEU score to evaluate the effectiveness of different  
methods.

3.2.1 Exact Match.Exact match (EM) measures the percentage  
of predictions that exactly match the ground truth. For code com-  
pletion, this is a strict metric that requires the model to generate  
exactly the same code line as the target.

3.2.2 Edit Similarity.Edit similarity (ES) measures how close the  
predicted code is to the ground truth based on the Levenshtein  
distance. It provides a more nuanced evaluation than accuracy by  
considering partial matches.

3.2.3 BLEU Score.BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score \[ 46 \]  
evaluates the quality of the generated code by comparing the n-  
gram overlap between the prediction and the ground truth.

\#\#\# 3.3 Embedding Models

Following previous work \[ 12 \], we utilize the following retrieval  
methods for similarity-based RAG:

\`\`\`  
(1)Random: For each code completion query, we randomly  
select𝐾items from the retrieval database.  
(2)BM25\[ 41 , 53 \]: A classical information retrieval algorithm  
that ranks documents based on term frequency and inverse  
document frequency, treating code snippets as text docu-  
ments, and computing relevance scores using keywords.  
BM25 has been widely used for code intelligence tasks \[ 9 ,  
11,75\].  
(3)CodeBERT\[ 8 \]: A BERT-based pre-trained model specifi-  
cally designed for programming language understanding,  
which we use to compute semantic embeddings of code snip-  
pets for similarity-based retrieval.  
(4)UniXcoder\[ 15 \]: A unified cross-modal pre-trained model  
for programming language, which supports both natural  
language and programming language understanding tasks,  
serving as our embedding generator for code retrieval.

programming languages, which we utilize its encoder to

\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 3.4 Research Questions

\`\`\`  
In this paper, we aim to answer four research questions.  
RQ1: How effective are RAG and fine-tuning approaches  
in industrial code completion?We evaluate the performance of  
directly applying LCMs to our code completion scenario and assess  
the improvements achieved through both RAG and fine-tuning  
approaches independently.  
RQ2: Can fine-tuning be effectively combined with RAG?  
We investigate whether combining fine-tuning with RAG can yield  
better performance than either approach alone, and analyze how  
fine-tuned models interact with the retrieval mechanism compared  
to base models.  
RQ3: How efficient are RAG and fine-tuning?We analyze the  
computational efficiency of each approach, measuring training and  
inference times, memory usage, and other resource requirements  
to understand their practical implications in industrial settings.  
RQ4: How do key parameters affect the performance of  
RAG and fine-tuning approaches?We conduct parameter sensi-  
tivity analysis from two aspects: (1) the impact of retrieved context  
size (Top-k) in RAG methods on model performance, and (2) the  
relationship between codebase scale and model effectiveness.  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 3.5 Implementation Details

\`\`\`  
In the RAG framework, we implement two distinct retrieval strate-  
gies. For similarity-based retrieval, we leverage the BM25S library  
to construct and maintain a lexical-based retrieval database, while  
utilizing the Qdrant \[ 50 \] service to establish a vector-based re-  
trieval system. For dependency-based retrieval, we first employ  
Tantivy \[ 57 \] to construct a mapping mechanism that links function  
names to their corresponding definitions. Subsequently, we utilize  
Tree-sitter \[ 58 \] to analyze the code structure and extract function  
call dependencies, enabling us to retrieve the relevant function  
definitions based on the identified function names.  
All the experiments are run on a server with Intel 8374C CPU and  
8\*A100 GPUs with 80GB of graphic memory. The hyper-parameter  
setting of the tuning procedure is listed in Table2 following previ-  
ous work. We enable the gradient checkpointing technique \[ 3 \] for  
LCMs to reduce the GPU memory consumption.  
For fast inference, we utilize vLLM \[ 26 \] based on PagedAtten-  
tion to improve efficiency. To eliminate the influence of random  
\`\`\`

sampling, we utilize greedy decoding strategy during inference. In  
addition, we employ the Flash-Attention technique \[ 7 \] for long-  
context optimization.

\#\#\# 4 Experiment Results

\#\#\# 4.1 RQ1: Effectiveness of RAG and Fine-Tuning

In this section, we present the performance of LCMs in our indus-  
trial code completion task in Table3. From the results, we can reach  
the following observations.  
LCMs demonstrate suboptimal performance on our in-  
dustrial code completion task. Among the six evaluated models,  
even the best-performing Qwen2.5-Coder 7B achieves only approxi-  
mately 28% EM and 44% BLEU score. These relatively low metrics in-  
dicate that these models struggle with our complex, domain-specific  
codebase that differs substantially from their training distribution.  
Furthermore, we observe a clear correlation between model size and  
completion performance. As the parameter count increases, models  
demonstrate better capability in capturing code patterns, leading to  
better task performance. This suggests that while the domain gap  
poses a notable challenge, larger models’ enhanced capacity allows  
them better to generalize their learned programming patterns to  
unfamiliar domains.  
Both RAG and fine-tuning demonstrate effectiveness in en-  
hancing model performance on industrial code completion  
tasks.ForRAGmethods, our experiments show that similarity-  
based retrieval (RAG𝑠𝑖𝑚) yields substantial improvements in com-  
pletion accuracy. Specifically, when using different embedding  
methods for retrieval, the model’s EM increases by 68.0%, 70.8%,  
and 98.3% for UniXcoder, CodeT5, and CoCoSoDa, respectively. Sur-  
prisingly, the simple BM25 method achieves the best performance  
among all RAG approaches, outperforming the second-best method  
CoCoSoDa by 9.3% in EM. The results suggest that in C++ code  
retrieval, lexical matching might be more effective than semantic  
matching through neural embeddings. This could be attributed to  
C++’s strict syntax and the prevalence of domain-specific identi-  
fiers, where exact keyword matches might be more indicative of  
relevance than contextual similarities captured by neural models.  
Moreover, we observe that RAG with CodeBERT embeddings per-  
forms poorly, showing similar results with random retrieval and  
even leading to slight performance degradation. This finding under-  
scores the critical dependence of similarity-based RAG on retrieval  
accuracy \- when the embedding model fails to effectively capture  
code similarities (as in the case of CodeBERT), it may adversely  
affect the code completion performance.  
For dependency-based retrieval RAG𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦, we observe  
modest improvements of 8.9% in EM compared to the base model.  
Such gains are substantially smaller than those achieved by similarity-  
based retrieval, suggesting that retrieving similar implementations  
is more beneficial than retrieving function dependencies for line-  
level code completion tasks.  
Fine-tuningalso demonstrates notable improvements in model  
performance. Specifically, after fine-tuning, the models show aver-  
age improvements of 78.3%, 21.3%, and 44.6% in exact match, edit  
similarity, and BLEU score respectively. However, we observe that  
the overall performance of fine-tuned models, while substantial,  
does not match the upper bound achieved by RAG𝑠𝑖𝑚-BM25 and

\`\`\`  
RAG𝑠𝑖𝑚-CoCoSoDa. Nevertheless, fine-tuning does outperform  
RAG𝑠𝑖𝑚variants using other embedding models, positioning it as  
a competitive adaptation strategy. This comparison suggests that  
while fine-tuning offers consistent improvements, the quality of  
retrieved examples in RAG approaches can potentially lead to supe-  
rior performance when optimal embedding models are employed.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 1:Our evaluation of LCMs on industrial code completion  
reveals that LCMs demonstrate limited effectiveness on industrial  
code completion, indicating a substantial domain gap. In addition,  
both RAG and fine-tuning substantially improve performance in  
all evaluation metrics. RAG approaches achieve a higher perfor-  
mance ceiling compared to fine-tuning, with BM25 emerging as  
the most effective method compared to neural embedding models.  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 4.2 RQ2: Combining RAG and Fine-Tuning

\`\`\`  
To investigate whether fine-tuning can be effectively combined with  
RAG, we conduct experiments using different retrieval methods on  
fine-tuned and base models. The results are shown in Table4. Note  
that the following experiments we focus on RAG𝑠𝑖𝑚due to their  
superior performance.  
Our experiments demonstrate that combining fine-tuning with  
RAG consistently yields better performance across all retrieval  
methods. For instance, using BM25 as the retrieval method, fine-  
tuned models with RAG achieve improvements of 3.67, 2.48, and 4\.  
absolute percentage points in EM, ES, and BLEU scores respectively,  
compared to base models with RAG. This performance boost is  
even more pronounced with other retrieval methods. Overall, the  
average improvements on the three metrics reach 7.79, 5.27, and  
7.91, respectively.  
These consistent improvements across different retrieval meth-  
ods suggest that fine-tuning and RAG complement each other effec-  
tively. The domain adaptation achieved through fine-tuning appears  
to enhance the model’s ability to better utilize retrieved contexts, re-  
sulting in superior performance compared to using either approach  
independently.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 2:Combining fine-tuning and RAG creates synergis-  
tic effects in improving code completion performance. When  
used together, these approaches consistently outperform their  
individual applications, with average improvements of 7.79%,  
5.27%, and 7.91% in exact match, edit similarity, and BLEU scores  
respectively.  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 4.3 RQ3: Efficiency of RAG and Fine-Tuning

\`\`\`  
According to previous work \[ 60 \], code completion is a time-sensitive  
task, leading efficiency to a crucial factor when adopting RAG and  
fine-tuning in this task. Therefore, in this section, we quantita-  
tively investigate the efficiency impact of RAG and fine-tuning  
approaches on code completion. Our analysis focuses on both the  
preparation stageandruntime stageto examine their time and  
resource consumption.

data and model size, the training process is computationally inten-  
sive as shown in Table5. On our 8×A100 80GB GPU server, training  
Qwen2.5-Coder requires 3.5 to 23.2 hours, varying by model size  
from 0.5B to 7B parameters, with GPU memory usage ranging from

\`\`\`  
18.3 GB to 74.8 GB. Similarly, training DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B and  
6.7B consumes 6.8 and 41.4 hours respectively, utilizing 17.6 GB  
and 67.2 GB of GPU memory. These substantial resource require-  
ments and A100 hours represent a remarkable bottleneck for the  
fine-tuning approach.  
For RAG approaches, the preparation stage primarily consists  
of two phases: embedding computation and index construction.  
As shown in Table6, the time consumption varies greatly across  
different methods. BM25, being a lexical-based method, requires  
no embedding computation and completes index construction in  
merely 2 minutes. In contrast, neural embedding-based methods  
incur substantial computational overhead. The embedding phase,  
executed on a single A100 GPU, takes between 34 minutes (CodeT5)  
and 74 minutes (UniXcoder). The subsequent indexing phase for  
these neural methods requires an additional 19-37 minutes, with  
UniXcoder taking the longest at 37 minutes. In total, while BM  
completes preparation in 2 minutes, neural embedding-based ap-  
proaches require 62-111 minutes. The variation in computation

time among neural models primarily stems from their architectural  
differences and embedding dimensions.  
\`\`\`  
4.3.2 Runtime Stage.For the runtime stage, the efficiency impact  
of RAG can be attributed to two main factors: (1) the embedding  
and retrieval phase of code completion queries (using embedding  
models), and (2) the increased query length due to the concatenation  
of Top-k retrieved code snippets, which subsequently affects model  
inference speed.  
For the first factor, we measure the time consumption of both em-  
bedding and retrieval phases across our five similarity-based RAG  
methods, with results shown in Table6. We find that during run-  
time, BM25 demonstrates superior efficiency with only 10.8ms for  
retrieval operations, obviously less than neural embedding-based  
methods. Among neural approaches, CodeBERT and UniXcoder  
show moderate latency (49.2ms and 46.8ms), while CodeT5 and  
CoCoSoDa require substantially more time (116ms and 114ms).  
For the second factor, we conduct an in-depth analysis using  
BM25 as a representative case to investigate how RAG affects query  
length and model inference efficiency. As shown in Figure1, we  
compare the average input length and model throughput across  
various scenarios: from base queries to queries augmented with  
top-1 through top-5 similar code snippets. The base queries have  
an average length of 246 tokens, but this length increases linearly  
with each additional retrieved code snippet, reaching approximately  
2,500 tokens when incorporating top-5 similar codes. This increase  
in input length significantly impacts the model’s throughput. Tak-  
ing BM25 as an example, the average processing speed drops sub-  
stantially from 4,031 tokens/second for base queries to around 874  
tokens/second when including top-5 retrieved snippets.  
In contrast, fine-tuning introduces no additional efficiency over-  
head during the runtime stage. After the resource-intensive fine-  
tuning process, where model parameters are adapted to our domain-  
specific dataset, the model can achieve substantial performance im-  
provements using only base queries during inference. This makes  
fine-tuning more efficient at runtime compared to RAG, despite its  
higher upfront computational costs during the preparation stage.

\`\`\`  
Finding 3:RAG and fine-tuning exhibit distinct efficiency trade-  
offs in code completion. Fine-tuning requires substantial compu-  
tational resources (e.g., 41.4 hours and 67.2 GB GPU memory for  
DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B) but introduces no runtime overhead. In  
contrast, RAG has minimal preparation costs but incurs runtime  
overhead through context retrieval and increased input lengths,  
reducing model throughput by up to 78% (from 4,031 to 874 to-  
kens/second) when using top-5 retrieved snippets.

combined with RAG, specifically examining performance changes  
as the number of retrieved contexts (top-k) increases. We exclude  
CodeBERT from this analysis due to its poor performance in se-  
lecting relevant contexts. As shown in Figure2, both base models  
and fine-tuned models demonstrate performance improvements  
as the number of retrieved contexts (K) increases. However, the  
improvement patterns differ significantly between them. While  
fine-tuned models combined with RAG achieve higher absolute  
performance, the marginal benefit (slope of improvement) from  
additional retrieved contexts is less pronounced compared to base  
models with RAG.  
4.4.2 Impact of the Scale of CodeBase.Both RAG and fine-tuning  
require a codebase during their adaptation process, i.e., either as a  
retrieval database or training dataset. In this research question, we  
investigate how sensitive these approaches are to the scale of the  
codebase. We randomly sample different sizes of C++ files (30k, 60k,  
90k, and 120k) from our codebase to create varying-sized retrieval  
databases and training sets. Due to the computational intensity  
of training and evaluation, we conduct experiments using Qwen  
models of smaller sizes (0.5B, 1.5B, and 3B parameters). For RAG,  
we focus on BM25 and CoCoSoDa as retrieval methods, as they  
demonstrate superior performance in our previous experiments.  
The results of these experiments are presented in Figure3.  
The experimental results reveal that both fine-tuning and RAG  
exhibit performance improvements as the codebase size increases,  
with the most substantial gains observed when transitioning from  
the base model to the 30K files included. Specifically, across the  
three model sizes, fine-tuning and RAG-BM25 demonstrate average  
relative improvements of 64.6% and 78.3% in EM, respectively. As  
the codebase expands further, the performance gains gradually  
diminish, but with notably different patterns between fine-tuning  
and RAG. When scaling from 90K to 120K files, fine-tuning shows  
diminishing returns, with average improvements of merely 0.35%  
and 0.16% percentage points in exact match and edit similarity  
across the three models. In contrast, RAG methods maintain more  
substantial improvements: RAG-BM25 and RAG-CoCoSoDa achieve

average EM gains of 2.26% and 2.13% across all model sizes. This  
phenomenon suggests that fine-tuning approaches a performance  
plateau in our dataset when the training data exceeds approximately  
300M tokens (90K files). However, RAG methods continue to derive  
meaningful benefits from larger-scale codebases, demonstrating  
better scalability in leveraging additional code resources.

\`\`\`  
Finding 4:Both RAG and fine-tuning demonstrate sensitivity  
to codebase scale but with distinct scaling patterns. While both  
approaches show substantial initial gains, fine-tuning exhibits  
diminishing returns beyond 90K files with minimal improvements.  
In contrast, RAG methods maintain meaningful performance  
gains even at larger scales (90K to 120K files), suggesting superior  
scalability in leveraging expanded codebases for code completion.

\#\#\# 5 Discussion

\#\#\# 5.1 Impact of Fine-tuning on Model’s

\#\#\# Generalization Ability

In this section, we evaluate the catastrophic forgetting effect on  
generalization ability induced by fine-tuning, specifically examining  
how the model’s performance on other tasks and benchmarks is  
affected after fine-tuning on our code repository. We select three  
representative tasks: code generation, code reasoning, and code  
translation. For code generation, following the work \[ 42 , 68 \], we  
evaluate the HumanEval and MBPP datasets using pass@1 as the

\`\`\`  
evaluation metric. For code reasoning, we employ the CRUX-Eval  
dataset \[ 14 \], where the model is required to infer either the output  
given code and input (CRUX-O), or the input given code and output  
(CRUX-I), also measured by pass@1. For code translation, we utilize  
the CodeXGLUE benchmark \[ 39 \], measuring performance with the  
CodeBLEU metric \[ 51 \]. The experimental results are presented in  
Table7, which demonstrates the model’s performance on these  
general tasks before and after fine-tuning on our domain-specific  
dataset.  
Based on our experimental results, we observe varying degrees  
of performance degradation across different tasks, indicating a  
nuanced pattern of catastrophic forgetting \[ 13 , 44 \]. Specifically,  
in code generation tasks, we observe average Pass@1 decreases  
of 24.1% and 11.7% on HumanEval and MBPP respectively. When  
evaluated with stricter test cases (+Plus), this performance gap  
widens to 24.0% and 16.7%.  
Regarding code reasoning and translation capabilities, we ob-  
serve a much milder impact from fine-tuning compared to code  
generation tasks. For code reasoning, fine-tuned models show aver-  
age decreases of 6.5% and 5.8% on CRUX-O and CRUX-I respectively.  
In code translation tasks, the impact is even smaller, with only a  
marginal decrease of 0.7% in C\#2Java and, notably, a slight improve-  
ment of 0.5% in Java2C\# after fine-tuning.  
This pattern suggests that fine-tuning our dataset has a min-  
imal negative impact on the model’s reasoning and translation

capabilities, starkly contrasting to the more substantial degrada-  
tion observed in code generation tasks. Particularly encouraging is  
the case of Java2C\# translation, where fine-tuned models actually  
outperform their base counterparts on average. We also observe a  
positive outlier with DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B, which shows improve-  
ments in both reasoning (3.0% and 6.0% on CRUX-O and CRUX-I  
respectively) and translation tasks after fine-tuning. These findings  
suggest that fine-tuning has varying impacts across different code-  
related capabilities. While code generation performance shows  
notable degradation, the effects on code reasoning and translation  
abilities are much less pronounced.

\#\#\# 5.2 Implication of Findings

In this section, we discuss the implications of our work for devel-  
opers and researchers.

5.2.1 For Developers.Our main results demonstrate that RAG and  
fine-tuning present distinct trade-offs in effectiveness and efficiency  
for practical applications. Based on these findings, we offer the  
following implications for developers adapting LLMs in industrial  
settings:  
(1)Exploring fine-grained source code segmentation for  
RAG: Our experiments, which used function-level retrieval, showed  
that adding a single relevant code snippet during inference increases  
input tokens by approximately 500 on average, which remarkably  
affects inference speed. Investigating finer-grained RAG approaches  
that reduce token length while maintaining retrieval effectiveness  
could lead to more efficient solutions. This might include exploring  
approaches such as snippet-level or statement-level retrieval.  
(2)Selecting RAG or fine-tuning based on available re-  
sources: RAG and fine-tuning consume computational resources at  
different stages of deployment. While RAG requires more computa-  
tional resources during runtime, fine-tuning demands substantial  
resources during the preparation stage. Given that training and  
inference typically utilize different GPU configurations \[ 23 , 52 \],  
developers should select their adaptation approach based on their

\`\`\`  
available resource distribution. In resource-rich environments, com-  
bining both approaches can yield optimal results.  
(3)Using RAG for ensuring LCMs’ generalization ability:  
When deploying models that need to handle diverse scenarios,  
RAG emerges as the preferred choice. Our experiments show that  
fine-tuning can compromise a model’s generalization abilities such  
as in code generation and reasoning tasks. Therefore, when the  
deployment scenario requires maintaining both domain-specific  
performance and general-purpose capabilities, RAG presents a more  
balanced solution.  
(4)Selecting RAG in data-rich scenarios: Our parametric stud-  
ies reveal that fine-tuning’s performance improvements plateau  
as the codebase scale increases, while RAG continues to show sig-  
nificant performance gains. In scenarios with abundant code data,  
RAG demonstrates superior scalability and can provide larger per-  
formance gains. This suggests that organizations with large pro-  
prietary codebases might find RAG particularly advantageous for  
their code completion systems.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.2.2 For Researchers.In Section4, we demonstrate that both fine-  
tuning and RAG are effective approaches for adapting LLMs to  
proprietary codebases, substantially improving code completion  
performance on private datasets. However, our findings reveal that  
each approach has distinct advantages and limitations, suggesting  
several promising research directions:  
(1)Exploring more advanced code embedding models: Our  
experiments show that RAG’s effectiveness is directly correlated  
with retrieval performance. Investigating more sophisticated code  
embedding models could lead to more relevant code retrieval and,  
consequently, better completion accuracy. This includes developing  
embedding techniques that better capture semantic relationships  
and domain-specific code patterns.  
(2)Exploring forgetting-aware fine-tuning techniques: While  
fine-tuning effectively improves domain-specific performance, we  
observe degradation in general capabilities, particularly in code  
generation tasks. Research into more robust fine-tuning techniques  
that maintain the model’s general capabilities while enhancing

domain-specific performance represents a crucial direction. This  
could involve exploring methods such as elastic weight consolida-  
tion \[25\] or knowledge distillation \[17\].  
(3)Optimizing long-context inference: We observe that in-  
ference speed is significantly affected by token length, particularly  
in industrial codebases which typically involve long and complex  
source code. Research into optimizing long-sequence handling,  
such as efficient attention mechanisms or context compression  
techniques, is crucial for improving the practical efficiency of code  
completion systems in industrial settings.

\#\#\# 5.3 Case Study

In this section, we conduct case studies to illustrate how fine-tuning  
and RAG influence LLM’s code completion predictions in practice.  
Figure4 demonstrates the varying completion results across  
different approaches. For the base code completion query (shown on  
the right), the base QC-7B model fails to predict the correct config-  
related operation, generating a plausible but incorrectRead(conf)  
call. This limitation stems from the model’s lack of knowledge about  
the proprietary codebase’s specific APIs and conventions.  
After fine-tuning, the model successfully generates the correct  
code snippet, specifically using theSetFileIfUnsetmethod. This  
improvement can be attributed to the model’s acquired knowledge  
aboutSNSLogicClientConfigand its associated usage patterns  
through training on the proprietary codebase.  
Similarly, the RAG-BM25 approach also generates the correct  
completion. The success of RAG can be traced to its retrieval mecha-  
nism, which identifies a relevant code snippet from anotherClient  
class (highlighted in red in the retrieved context). This retrieved  
code example contains similar config operations, providing a valu-  
able reference for the current prediction task. This demonstrates  
how RAG effectively leverages existing codebase knowledge to  
guide accurate code completion.

\#\#\# 5.4 Threat to Validity

External Validity: Our study primarily relies on an industrial code-  
base from our collaborating company, which may exhibit company-  
specific patterns and practices that differ from other software or-  
ganizations. To mitigate this limitation, we deliberately collect a  
diverse set of code samples across different functional domains and  
business units within the company. Our dataset encompasses over

\`\`\`  
160,000 code files, providing a comprehensive representation of the  
department’s development practices and coding patterns.  
Internal Validity: The efficiency measurements in our study  
are conducted under our available computational configurations.  
The relative performance characteristics of RAG and fine-tuning  
approaches might vary under different resource constraints. Specif-  
ically, the efficiency trade-offs could shift with varying training  
resources (GPU configurations), inference resources (deployment  
environments), or CPU resources (for retrieval operations). This  
suggests that our efficiency results should be interpreted within  
the context of our experimental setup.

\#\#\# 6.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation

\`\`\`  
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an approach that im-  
proves generation quality by incorporating information from ex-  
ternal knowledge sources. This approach enhances the accuracy  
and reliability of LLMs’ outputs and is widely used in code-related  
tasks \[ 38 , 65 \]. For example, Reacc \[ 38 \] leverages both lexical copy-  
ing and referring to code with similar semantics to improve code  
completion. Parvez et al. \[ 47 \] propose REDCODER which enhances  
code generation and summarization by retrieving and leveraging  
relevant code snippets and summaries from a reference database.  
Similarly, Wang et al. \[ 65 \] and Peng et al. \[ 48 \] advanced automatic  
program repair by explicitly utilizing fix templates from historical  
bug-fix pairs.

\#\#\# 6.2 Large Code Models

\`\`\`  
Recently, Large Code Models have emerged as powerful tools for di-  
verse software engineering tasks \[ 21 , 22 , 33 , 34 , 43 , 61 , 62 , 68 , 71 , 74 ,  
76 \]. Various influential models have demonstrated significant capa-  
bilities in code generation and understanding. For example, Meta’s  
Code Llama \[ 54 \] is a foundation model that builds upon the original  
LLaMA architecture and extends the context window to 16K tokens  
and serves as a versatile foundation model for programming tasks.  
DeepSeek-Coder\[ 16 \] is a series of large code models that have an ar-  
chitecture identical to CodeLlama. DeepSeek-Coder is trained from  
2T tokens from scratch, achieving state-of-the-art performance  
in a variety of code intelligence tasks. Qwen2.5 Coder \[ 18 \] is a  
family of LCMs based on models of the Qwen2.5 series. Qwen2.  
undergoes four-stage training with a total number of 5.5T tokens,  
presenting state-of-the-art performance in both code generation  
and reasoning.  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# 6.3 Code Completion

\`\`\`  
Code completion predicts subsequent code tokens or statements to  
assist programmers during software development \[ 29 – 32 \]. With the  
development of deep learning, various DL-based code completion  
methods are applied to code completion and achieve state-of-the-art  
performance. For instance, Li et al. \[ 28 \] proposed a point-mixture  
network to relieve the out-of-vocabulary problem in sequence-  
to-sequence code completion. Izadi et al. \[ 20 \] proposed CodeFill,  
which integrates both type and semantic information to improve the  
precision of completion. Recent research has increasingly focused  
on leveraging repository-level context. For example, Repocoder \[ 74 \]  
utilizes useful information scattered in different files by iterative

evaluate code completion systems under complex and multi-file

\#\#\# 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ef-  
fectiveness of RAG and fine-tuning in LCM-based code completion  
in the industry. We reveal the effectiveness and efficiency trade-offs  
when adopting the two methods: RAG achieves a higher perfor-  
mance ceiling while introducing non-trivial runtime completion  
overhead. Our findings provide guidance for both researchers and  
developers for further research directions and LCM adoption.
