\#\# Abstract

\`\`\`  
Recent years have witnessed the deployment of  
code language models (LMs) in various code  
intelligence tasks such as code completion. Yet,  
it is challenging for pre-trained LMs to generate  
correct completions in private repositories. Pre-  
vious studies retrieve cross-file context based  
on import relations or text similarity, which is  
insufficiently relevant to completion targets. In  
this paper, we propose a dataflow-guided re-  
trieval augmentation approach, calledDRACO,  
for repository-level code completion.DRACO  
parses a private repository into code entities and  
establishes their relations through an extended  
dataflow analysis, forming a repo-specific con-  
text graph. Whenever triggering code comple-  
tion,DRACOprecisely retrieves relevant back-  
ground knowledge from the repo-specific con-  
text graph and generates well-formed prompts  
to query code LMs. Furthermore, we construct  
a large Python dataset, ReccEval, with more  
diverse completion targets. Our experiments  
demonstrate the superior accuracy and appli-  
cable efficiency ofDRACO, improving code  
exact match by 3.43% and identifier F1-score  
by 3.27% on average compared to the state-of-  
the-art approach.

\#\# 1 Introduction

\`\`\`  
Pre-trained language models (LMs) of code (Chen  
et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023a,b; Allal et al.,  
2023; Li et al., 2023b) have shown remarkable per-  
formance in improving programming productivity  
(Kazemitabaar et al., 2023; Dakhel et al., 2023).  
Instead of using a single code file, well-designed  
programs emphasize separating complicated func-  
tionality into independent modules (Barnett and  
Constantine, 1968). While facilitating collabora-  
tive development and software maintenance, it in-  
troduces the real-world problem ofrepository-level  
code completion: given an unfinished code file in

Figure 1: A real-world example of repository-level code  
completion. The code LM CodeGen25-7B-mono fails  
to complete the last code line correctly when entering  
only the unfinished code (Zero-Shot). The model needs  
background knowledge relevant tonewSignal, and the  
retrieval of this knowledge can be guided by dataflow.

a private repository, complete the following pieces  
of code at the cursor position.  
Despite pre-training on large-scale corpora, code  
LMs are still blind to unique naming conventions  
and programming styles in private repositories (Pei  
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b; Ding et al., 2023).  
Previous works finetune LMs to leverage cross-  
file context (Ding et al., 2024; Shrivastava et al.,  
2023a,b), which requires additional training data  
and is difficult to work with larger LMs. Re-  
cently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is  
widely used to aid pre-trained LMs with external  
knowledge and maintain their parameters intact  
(Lewis et al., 2020; Mallen et al., 2023; Trivedi  
et al., 2023). For repository-level code completion,  
the retrieval database is the current private repos-  
itory. The state-of-the-art approach, RepoCoder  
(Zhang et al., 2023), iteratively incorporates a text  
similarity-based retriever and a code LM.  
As shown in Figure 1, the CodeGen25 Python  
model (Nijkamp et al., 2023a) with 7 billion pa-  
rameters assigns a value to the attributechannel  
of the objectnewSignal, which seems rational in  
7957  
\`\`\`

the unfinished code but is actually outside the list  
of valid attributes. Due to the lack of similar code  
snippets in the repository, the text similarity-based  
approach (Zhang et al., 2023\) also fails to com-  
plete the correct code line. From a programmer’s  
perspective, one would explore the data origin of  
the variablenewSignalin the last line. It comes  
from the callsignal.getSignalByName, where  
the variable type ofsignalisRecordSignalim-  
ported from the moduleRecordSignal. After pro-  
viding relevant background knowledge in the pri-  
vate repository, the model would know that the  
variable type ofnewSignalis the classSignal  
and thus call the correct function.  
Inspired by this programming behavior in pri-  
vate repositories, we proposeDRACO, a novel  
dataflow-guided retrieval augmentation approach  
for repository-level code completion, which steers  
code LMs with relevant background knowledge  
rather than similar code snippets. Dataflow analy-  
sis is a static program analysis reacting to data de-  
pendency relations between variables in a program.  
In this work, we extend traditional dataflow analy-  
sis by setting type-sensitive dependency relations.  
We employ the standard RAG framework (Lewis  
et al., 2020): (i)Indexing, which parses a private  
repository into code entities and establishes their  
relations through dataflow analysis, forming a repo-  
specific context graph for retrieval. (ii)Retrieval,  
which uses dataflow analysis to obtain fine-grained  
import information in the unfinished code and re-  
trieves relevant code entities from the pre-built con-  
text graph. (iii)Generation, which organizes the  
relevant background knowledge as natural code and  
concatenates it with the unfinished code to generate  
well-formed prompts for querying code LMs.  
In addition to the existing dataset CrossCodeE-  
val (Ding et al., 2023\) for repository-level code  
completion, we construct a new dataset, ReccE-  
val, with diverse completion targets collected from  
Python Package Index (PyPI).^1 We conduct exper-  
iments with popular LMs including adapted code  
LMs (Rozière et al., 2023), specialized code LMs  
(Nijkamp et al., 2023a,b; Allal et al., 2023; Li  
et al., 2023b), and GPT models (Ouyang et al.,  
2022; OpenAI, 2023). Our experiments demon-  
strate thatDRACOachieves generally superior ac-  
curacy across all settings. Furthermore,DRACOis  
plug-and-play for various code LMs and efficient  
to real-time code completion.

Code completion. Early studies adopt statistical  
LMs (Raychev et al., 2014; Proksch et al., 2015;  
Raychev et al., 2016; He et al., 2021\) and neural  
models (Li et al., 2018; Svyatkovskiy et al., 2019;  
Kim et al., 2021; Izadi et al., 2022; Tufano et al.,  
2023\) for code completion. After pre-training on  
large-scale code corpora, code LMs are familiar  
with frequent code patterns and achieve superior  
performance (Chen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021;  
Wang et al., 2021; Le et al., 2022; Allal et al., 2023;  
Li et al., 2023b; Nijkamp et al., 2023a,b; Shen  
et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023). Unlike single-  
file code completion, repository-level code comple-  
tion draws much attention to practical development.  
Ding et al. (2024) learn in-file and cross-file context  
jointly on top of pre-trained LMs. Lu et al. (2022)  
present ReACC to train a code-to-code search re-  
triever and a code completion generator with an  
external source code database. Shrivastava et al.  
(2023b) generate example-specific prompts using  
a prompt proposal classifier and further propose  
RepoFusion (Shrivastava et al., 2023a) to incorpo-  
rate relevant repository context by training code  
LMs. RepoCoder (Zhang et al., 2023\) is an itera-  
tive retrieval-generation framework to approximate  
the intended completion target. Despite their good  
performance, these methods are limited by the high  
overhead of extra training or iterative generation.

dated in pre-trained LMs, RAG has achieved state-  
of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks (Cai  
et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023).  
Usually, RAG integrates the retrieved knowledge  
with frozen pre-trained LMs (Ram et al., 2023;  
Levine et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023). There exist  
different types of retrievals including term-based  
sparse retriever (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009;  
Trivedi et al., 2023), embedding-based dense re-  
triever (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020),  
commercial search engines (Nakano et al., 2021;  
Liu et al., 2023), and LMs themself (Yu et al., 2023;  
Sun et al., 2023). RAG is also broadly applied to  
code intelligence tasks such as code summariza-  
tion (Liu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhou  
et al., 2023\) and code generation (Hashimoto et al.,  
2018; Parvez et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023a). In this  
work, we leverage dataflow analysis to guide re-  
trieval, which mines more precise data dependency  
information for repository-level code completion.

\#\# 3 Methodology

As shown in Figure 2,DRACOemploys the stan-  
dard RAG framework (Lewis et al., 2020\) includ-  
ing indexing (§3.2), retrieval (§3.3), and genera-  
tion (§3.4). Because both indexing and retrieval in  
DRACOrely on the extended dataflow analysis, we  
first introduce it in §3.1. In this work, we focus on  
Python and the code completion of currently edited  
line, which simulates real-world scenarios where  
users are programming in integrated development  
environments (IDEs) and only the context before  
the cursor is visible.

\`\`\`  
3.1 Dataflow Analysis  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Dataflow analysis is a static program analysis that  
reacts to the data dependency relations between  
variables in a program, producing a dataflow graph  
(DFG), in which nodes represent the variables and  
edges indicate where the variables come from and  
where they go. It provides code semantic informa-  
tion that is not affected by personal naming con-  
ventions and programming styles.  
We assume that the background knowledge rele-  
vant to variable types is crucial for code completion.  
Take the statementv \= f(p)as an example, the  
parameterphas far less influence on the variable  
vthan the callfdoes. Therefore, we extend tra-  
ditional dataflow analysis by setting dependency  
relation types. We focus on fivetype-sensitive re-  
lations, which indicate what the variable type is or  
where it derives from:  
\`\`\`  
\- Assignsrelation is a one-to-one correspon-  
    dence in an assignment statement, which con-  
    trols variable creation and mutation.  
\- Asrelation is fromwithorexceptstatements  
    and similar with theassignsrelation.  
\- Refersrelation represents a reference to an  
    existing variable or its attribute.  
\- Typeofrelation is from the explicit type hints  
    (van Rossum and Lehtosalo, 2022\) written by  
    programmers, indicating the data type of the  
    (return) value of a variable or function.  
\- Inheritsrelation is an implicit data depen-  
    dency relation since a subclass inherits all the  
    class members of its base classes.  
Our DFG is a heterogeneous directed acyclic  
graphG={(h, r, t)|h, t∈E, r∈R}, whereE

\`\`\`  
denotes the entity set,Rdenotes the type-sensitive  
relation set, and a triplet(h, r, t)represents the  
head entityhpointing to the tail entitytwith the  
relationr. The details of our DFG construction are  
shown in Appendix A.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.2 Repo-specific Context Graph  
Offline preprocessing is often used in RAG to index  
a retrieval database. Instead of treating source code  
as text (Lu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023), we  
parse a private repository into code entities and es-  
tablish their relations through our dataflow analysis,  
forming a repo-specific context graph.  
For each code file in a repository, we traverse its  
abstract syntax tree (AST) to collect code entities  
including modules, classes, functions, and vari-  
ables. A module entity stores its file path and doc-  
string as properties. A class entity stores its name,  
signature, docstring, and starting line number. A  
function entity stores its name, signature, docstring,  
body, and starting line number. A variable entity  
stores its name, statement, and starting line number.  
There are naturalcontainsrelations between these  
entities, e.g., the classRecordSignalcontainsits  
member functiongetSignalByName. Based on the  
type-sensitive relations in DFG, we establishde-  
pendsrelations between the entity pairs in indi-  
vidual modules, e.g.,Signalis the return type of  
the functiongetSignalByName. Eventually, we es-  
tablishdependsrelations between the variables in  
localimportstatements and the pointing entities  
in other modules, e.g., the importedSignalpoints  
to the classSignalin another module.  
\`\`\`  
3.3 Dataflow-Guided Retrieval  
Given an unfinished code, we identify fine-grained  
import information by dataflow analysis and re-  
trieve relevant entities from the repo-specific con-  
text graph. We do not intend to perform precise  
type inference (Peng et al., 2022\) for a dynamically  
typed language like Python, but rather provide rele-  
vant background knowledge to code LMs, which  
provides the definitions of code entities such as  
class members and function arguments.  
All cross-file context is indicated by local  
importstatements in Python. However, only using  
such coarse-grained import information may over-  
look the knowledge of its specific usages (Ding  
et al., 2024). We denote import information by  
(module, name), wheremoduleindicates another  
code file in the repository andnameindicates the  
specific code entity. Particularly,namecan be ex-

\`\`\`  
panded by itsrefersrelations in the extracted DFG.  
For example, we would obtain the fine-grained im-  
port information(module, name.attr)if there is  
a code statement containingname.attr.  
For each localimportstatement, we collect  
a set of fine-grained import information. Im-  
port information points to code entities in the  
repo-specific context graph, which is achieved  
through directory structure and string matching.  
Let us see Figure 2 for example. Given the  
fine-grained import information (RecordSignal,  
RecordSignal.getSignalByName), we first iden-  
tify the corresponding module entitypyPhases-  
Recordloader/RecordSignal.pythrough directory  
structure. Then, the code entitygetSignalByName  
in classRecordSignalcontained in the module  
is located by string matching. Finally, the rele-  
vant entities are retrieved alongdependsrelations  
using a depth-first search. The retrieved entities  
provide comprehensive type-related background  
knowledge for both cross-file imports and usages  
in the unfinished code.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.4 Prompt Generation  
Before querying LMs, we restore the retrieved enti-  
ties to the source code and concatenate it with the  
unfinished code to generate well-formed prompts.  
As the maximum input lengths of LMs are finite  
and fixed, we employ the dynamic context allo-  
cation strategy in (Shrivastava et al., 2023b). It  
pre-allocates half of the total input lengths for the  
relevant background knowledge and the other half  
for the unfinished code. If either is shorter than the  
allocated length, the remaining tokens are allocated  
to the other. For the overlong unfinished code, we  
just truncate it to obtain the last tokens. Given  
the numbernof tokens allocated to the relevant  
background knowledge, we next describe the gen-  
eration process of background knowledge. Refer  
to Algorithms 1 and 2 in Appendix B for details.  
Algorithm 1 describes the center control of the  
generation process. We consider the entities that  
have data relations with the line to be completed  
as the most relevant entities, which are denoted by  
Erand form the primary background knowledge.  
The entities from other localimportstatements are  
denoted byEoand are incrementally added to the  
background knowledge until the length exceeds the  
allocated tokensn. This design helps LMs further  
understand the context while prevents the primary  
background knowledge from being truncated.  
Our mission is to organize the prompts like the  
\`\`\`

original code to maintain the nature of programs  
(Hindle et al., 2012), as described in Algorithm 2\.  
We group the relevant entities in modules and  
merge those withcontainsrelations to avoid redun-  
dancy, e.g., class members would not be duplicated  
if the class already exists. The code entities in the  
same module are sorted by their starting line num-  
bers. Therefore, we construct a module graphGm,  
where an edgem 1 →m 2 indicates that there exists  
an entity inm 1 thatdependson an entity inm 2\.  
The modules in prompts are ranked by a pseudo-  
topological sort with two priorities: (i) Dependent  
modules come first. The content ofm 2 should be  
placed in front of that ofm 1 , which is consistent  
with programming conventions (Lines 10–15 in Al-  
gorithm 2). (ii) Once there are multiple options for  
topological sort in a directed cyclic graph, the rele-  
vant modules are placed ahead (Liu et al., 2024a).  
We prefer the modules that are reachable from the  
entities inErthan those inEo(i.e., relevant or not).  
The entities within bothErandEoare sorted in  
ascending order by their starting line numbers, re-  
sulting in an ordered listEcof the import entities  
(Lines 3–9, 13). Note that a comment “\# file path  
of the module” is put ahead of each module to in-  
dicate the relative directory structure. Finally, we  
place the relevant background knowledge inside  
a multi-line string, which precedes the unfinished  
code to generate the prompts for querying LMs.  
Benefiting from the design of our repo-specific  
context graph, there are two prompt scopes, named  
definitionandcomplete, to control the details of  
code entities. Compared with only definitions,  
prompts under thecompletescope contain specific  
function bodies and variable statements.

\#\# 4 Experiment Setup

\`\`\`  
4.1 Datasets  
The widely-used datasets (Raychev et al., 2016; Lu  
et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2023\) for code completion  
only provide a single unfinished code file as input.  
Several recent benchmarks (Zhang et al., 2023; Liu  
et al., 2024b) evaluate next-line prediction, which  
is different from our concern with the currently  
edited line. CrossCodeEval (Ding et al., 2023\) is a  
multilingual benchmark for repository-level code  
completion, where the statement to be completed  
has at least one use of cross-file API. Since we  
focus on Python, we evaluate ourDRACOon the  
Python subset of CrossCodeEval.  
We further build a new Python dataset ReccE-

\`\`\`  
4.2 Implementation Details  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
We evaluate the retrieval-augmented methods that  
do not involve training, which excludes several  
works (Shrivastava et al., 2023a,b; Lu et al., 2022).  
See Appendix C.2 for more details:  
\`\`\`  
\- Zero-Shotdirectly feeds the unfinished code  
    to code LMs, which evaluates their perfor-  
    mance without any cross-file information.  
\- CCFinder (Ding et al., 2024\) is a cross-  
    file context finder tool retrieving the relevant  
    cross-file context from the pre-built project  
    context graph byimportstatements. We con-  
    duct experiments for CCFinder-k(k= 1, 2 ),  
    which indicates that CCFinder retrievesk-hop  
    neighbors of cross-file code entities.  
\- RG-1 and RepoCoder(Zhang et al., 2023\)  
    construct a retrieval database through a slid-  
    ing window and retrieve similar code snip-  
    pets using text similarity-based retrievers. Re-  
    poCoder is an iterative retrieval-generation  
    framework, which retrieves the database with  
    the results generated in the previous iteration.  
    RG-1 represents the standard RAG and is the  
    first iteration of RepoCoder.  
As shown in Table 2, we conduct comprehensive  
experiments on seven popular LMs. For a method,  
we first preprocess all repositories in the datasets.  
Then, we generate prompts for the unfinished code  
and record the time used. Finally, we acquire the  
completion results by feeding the prompts to LMs.  
A prediction is the first line of a completion result.

4.3 Evaluation Metrics  
\`\`\`  
We evaluate the accuracy of each method by code  
match and identifier match scores (Ding et al.,  
2023), as well as the efficiency by prompt gen-  
eration time. We report the average of each metric.  
See Appendix C.4 for more details:

\- Code match.We directly compare the pre-  
    diction with the reference, which is measured  
    using exact match (EM) and edit similarity  
(ES) (Lu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023).  
\- Identifier match.We evaluate the predicted  
    APIs by identifier exact match (ID.EM) and  
       F1-score (Ding et al., 2023).  
\- Prompt generation time. We record the  
    prompt generation time to evaluate the effi-  
    ciency of each method, which is a new and  
    significant metric for real-time completion.

\#\# 5 Experimental Results and Analysis

\`\`\`  
5.1 Performance Comparison  
The performance comparison on the CrossCodeE-  
val and ReccEval datasets is listed in Tables 3 and 4,  
respectively. Additional results on other CodeGen  
models are supplemented in Appendix D.1. Over-  
all,DRACOsignificantly improves the accuracy  
of various code LMs. Particularly, the CodeGen-  
350M model integrated withDRACOeven outper-  
forms the zero-shot StarCoder-15.5B model.  
In comparison to other retrieval-augmented  
methods,DRACOalso shows generally superior  
accuracy across all settings. The average absolute  
improvement on EM, ES, ID.EM, and F1 versus  
RepoCoder is 3.43%, 1.00%, 3.62%, and 3.27%,  
respectively. RepoCoder retrieves similar code  
demonstrations that help increase the ES metric  
of completion results. But RepoCoder ignores the  
validity of its generated identifiers in private repos-  
itories, which decreases the metrics for code exact  
match and identifier match. Such almost correct  
completion results may introduce unconscious bugs  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
to the programmers who are unfamiliar with the  
repository. In contrast,DRACOpresents the defi-  
nitions of relevant code entities, providing better  
control over code LMs to generate valid identifiers.  
Moreover, the background knowledge can be used  
as a reference to help the programmers understand  
and review the completion results in IDEs.DRACO  
using the CodeGen-350M model is slightly worse  
than RepoCoder in terms of code match metrics  
on the ReccEval dataset, as the model may not be  
powerful enough to capture the data relations in  
our provided background knowledge.  
CCFinder retrieves cross-file code entities by  
plain import relations. The entities retrieved by  
CCFinder were originally designed to be encoded  
for training code LMs. When used as a retrieval-  
augmented method, CCFinder retrieves too many  
code entities based on coarse-grained import in-  
formation, resulting in truncation of truly relevant  
context. As a result, CCFinder-2 with more re-  
trieved entities only exceeds CCFinder-1 slightly  
on the StarCoder model that supports longer in-  
puts. Therefore, the subsequent analysis experi-  
ments are conducted with CCFinder-1. Guiding  
by our dataflow analysis,DRACOretrieves rele-  
vant code entities more precisely, leading to signifi-  
cantly superior accuracy.  
The performance of code completion varies on  
the two datasets. First, according to the statistics in  
Table 1, the average reference length of ReccEval  
is significantly shorter than that of CrossCodeE-  
val, leading to the higher EM metrics of both code  
and identifier on ReccEval. Moreover, all inputs  
of CrossCodeEval end with a dot where a correct  
API is required in the first place, which is more  
suitable for CCFinder andDRACOthat retrieve  
code definitions. Many inputs of ReccEval end  
with partial names of the target APIs, which facili-  
tates text similarity-based retrievals including RG-  
and RepoCoder. Therefore, the lead ofDRACOon  
CrossCodeEval is more significant.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.2 Efficiency Evaluation  
The time spent on prompt generation is perceived  
by users whenever code completion is triggered.  
Table 5 shows the prompt generation time of  
each method using the CodeGen-350M model,  
and additional results are shown in Appendix D.2.  
CCFinder andDRACOrequire parsing the unfin-  
ished code into an AST or a DFG, which is slightly  
slower than RG-1 with text similarity-based re-  
trieval but still comparable. RepoCoder relies on

on the smallest CodeGen-350M model and may not  
be feasible for real-time code completion.  
In summary,DRACOis efficient for real-time  
code completion in IDEs. Compared to the meth-  
ods with comparable efficiency (i.e., excluding Re-  
poCoder),DRACOis considerably ahead in the  
accuracy of repository-level code completion.

5.3 Ablation Study

To analyze the effectiveness of dataflow analysis  
inDRACO, we conduct an ablation study shown  
in Tables 6 and 17\. “w/o cross\_df” disablesde-  
pendsrelations in the repo-specific context graph,  
makingDRACOunable to handle the data depen-  
dency relations in other code files. “w/o intra\_df”  
disables the dataflow analysis for the unfinished  
code, which only allowsDRACOto retrieve coarse-  
grained import information in the order of their  
starting line numbers. “w/o dataflow” degenerates  
DRACOinto a naive method that simply takes the  
imported cross-file entities in the unfinished code  
as the relevant background knowledge.

Figure 3: Performance comparison of two prompt  
scopes on the CrossCodeEval dataset.  
The ablation study demonstrates that the com-  
pleteDRACOachieves the best performance, and  
all usages of dataflow analysis play a positive role  
in repository-level code completion. It can be ob-  
served that the enhancement of the “intra\_df” com-  
ponent on the StarCoder model is less than that on  
other models. This component places the more rel-  
evant background knowledge in front of the prompt  
to prevent truncation, which is weakened to some  
extent on the StarCoder model with a maximum  
context length of 8K tokens.  
The accuracy ofDRACOwithout dataflow anal-  
ysis is still comparable with CCFinder. CCFinder  
groups the relevant context in code entities, which  
is counter-intuitive for source code (see the exam-  
ple shown in Appendix E.1). The results reveal that  
the well-formed prompts generated byDRACOcan  
better steer code LMs, even if the depth-first search  
for dependent code entities is absent.

5.4 Analysis of Prompt Scopes  
The prompts generated byDRACOconsist of the  
definitions of code entities, which provide options  
for thedefinitionandcompletescopes, as described  
in Section 3.4. We further conduct experiments to  
evaluate the influence of the two prompt scopes.  
The results on the CrossCodeEval and ReccEval  
datasets are shown in Figures 3 and 6, respectively.  
DRACOwith thecompletescope achieves the  
best performance across all settings, which indi-  
cates that code implementation can further enhance  
LMs. Implementation details can provide a deeper  
understanding of code entities, along with the pro-  
gramming styles. Moreover, DRACOwith thedef-  
initionscope outperforms CCFinder and RG-1 in  
most settings (cf. Tables 3 and 4), suggesting that  
the definitions without specific implementations  
are also useful for code LMs. Since an implemen-  
tation is usually much longer than its definitions,  
both prompt scopes are optional in practical appli-  
cations, in a trade-off between accuracy and cost.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.5 Analysis of Adapted LM  
\`\`\`  
We analyze the effect of different maximum input  
lengths for different types of LMs. Specifically,  
we evaluate Code Llama-7B and StarCoder-15.5B  
with 2K, 4K, and 8K tokens. The performance  
changes are shown in Figure 4, and the complete  
results are presented in Tables 18–21.  
With the increase of the maximum input length,  
the accuracy ofDRACOapplied to Code Llama  
decreases, which shows the opposite trend of the  
StarCoder model. Code Llama is created by further  
training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets. It is

different from specialized code LMs such as Star-  
Coder which are mainly pre-trained on code cor-  
pora. With similar background knowledge, Code  
Llama-7B does not have enough capability to cap-  
ture data dependency relations in long Python code,  
leading to the degraded accuracy ofDRACO. In  
contrast, specialized code LMs can understand  
longer code context and may be a better choice  
for repository-level code completion.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.6 Analysis of GPT Models  
We randomly sample 50 examples from Cross-  
CodeEval and evaluate them with GPT-3.5, GPT-  
4, and StarCoder-15.5B. The results shown in Ta-  
ble 7 reveal that: (i)DRACOcan also significantly  
enhance GPT models and achieve superior accu-  
racy. (ii) Code completion with GPT models suf-  
fers from the difficulties in output format and API  
\`\`\`

cost. Given the long context of repository-level  
code completion, there lacks sufficient length to  
place the demonstrations required for in-context  
learning (Brown et al., 2020). It is hard to control  
the output format of GPT models through instruc-  
tion, which may introduce bias into the evaluation,  
especially for RG-1 with GPT-4. Moreover, the  
API cost for this evaluation (only 50 examples) is  
nearly 35 US dollars. (iii) Excluding the effect of  
wrong output format, we may assume “GPT-4 \>  
StarCoder-15.5B \> GPT-3.5” for this task.

\#\# 6 Conclusions

This paper proposesDRACO, a dataflow-guided  
retrieval augmentation approach for repository-  
level code completion. To guide more precise re-  
trieval, an extended dataflow analysis is designed  
by setting type-sensitive data dependency relations.  
DRACOindexes private repositories to form repo-  
specific context graphs and retrieves relevant back-  
ground knowledge from them, which is assembled  
with the unfinished code to generate well-formed  
prompts for querying code LMs. The experiments  
on the CrossCodeEval dataset and our ReccEval  
dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy and ap-  
plicable efficiency ofDRACO. In future work, we  
will explore other structured code representations.

\#\# Ethical Considerations

\`\`\`  
The code generated by pre-trained LMs may con-  
tain non-existent APIs or even introduce potential  
bugs. The retrieval-augmented approaches includ-  
ing ours mitigate this issue only to some extent. We  
recommend presenting our retrieved background  
knowledge to programmers for review and taking  
appropriate care of these risks if deploying our ap-  
proach in real-world applications.

\#\# Limitations

\`\`\`  
DRACOrelies on a code LM to support long in-  
puts and capture data dependency relations in the  
provided background knowledge. Thus, the perfor-  
mance ofDRACOmay be limited by the capability  
of the code LM. According to our experiments,  
DRACOstill has a considerable improvement on  
the smallest CodeGen-350M model with 2K tokens,  
which mitigates this limitation.  
The effectiveness ofDRACOmay degrade when  
the code intent is unclear. For new line or function  
body completion, the guidance of dataflow analysis  
is weakened sinceDRACOmay not be able to set  
priorities for import information. We focus on the  
code completion of currently edited line and eval-  
uate multi-line code completion in Appendix D.4.  
Future work may explore the role of dataflow anal-  
ysis in different completion scenarios.  
DRACOrequires changes to migrate to other pro-  
gramming languages. Our idea of guiding retrieval  
with dataflow analysis is not limited to Python.  
However, due to the different characteristics of  
programming languages,DRACOneeds to extend  
dataflow analysis for target languages. The variety  
of static analysis tools for common programming  
languages provides convenience for implementing  
multilingual DRACO.

\#\# A Dataflow Graph Construction

\`\`\`  
We first parse the Python code into an AST by tree-  
sitter,^3 which is feasible to parse incomplete code  
snippets. Based on the AST, we extract variables as  
the entity set and identify type-sensitive relations  
as triplets, forming our DFG. The implementation  
involves specific Python syntax features and is pre-  
sented in our published code.  
The type-sensitive relations are listed in Table 8\.  
We also introduce an example to visualize our DFG  
construction, as shown in Figure 5\. The extracted  
variables include identifiers (e.g.,newSignal) and  
attributes (e.g.,signal.getSignalByName). The  
type-sensitive relations are identified as described  
in Section 3.1. For example, the parametersignal:  
RecordSignalindicates a triplet (RecordSignal,  
Typeof,signal). The assignment statement forms  
a triplet (signal.getSignalByName, Assigns,  
newSignal), and the parameternewChannelName  
is a type-insensitive relation pruned in our DFG.

\#\# C Details of Experiment Setup

\`\`\`  
C.1 Details of Dataset Construction  
We collect the projects that are first released on  
PyPI between 2023-01-01 to 2023-04-28, which  
is after the releases of pre-training corpora (Hu-  
sain et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Kocetkov et al.,  
2023). We pick the projects with permissive li-  
censes (i.e., MIT, Apache, and BSD) and filter  
out those that have fewer than 6 or more than 100  
Python code files. We identify the usages of local  
imported resources and randomly select a subse-  
quent token as the cursor position. The context  
before the cursor is the input, while the current line  
after the cursor is the reference. For the diversity  
of ReccEval, we limit the maximum number of  
examples to one per code file and 10 per reposi-  
tory. Moreover, we ensure that the reference is not  
in the unfinished code and feed the examples to  
StarCoderBase-1B model (Li et al., 2023b) to re-  
move the exact matches (Ding et al., 2023), which  
excludes strong clues in the unfinished code to  
make ReccEval more challenging.

C.2 Implementation Details of Baselines  
We describe more implementation details of  
CCFinder, RG-1, and RepoCoder, which are in  
line with the experiment setup in their papers:  
\`\`\`  
\- CCFinder. Because CCFinder is not open  
    source, we reproduce it according to its paper.  
We do not limit the number of retrieved code  
entities, as the cross-file context would be trun-  
cated if it exceeds the maximum length. We  
also re-order the retrieved entities, ensuring  
the entities from the same source file follow  
the original code order.  
\- RG-1 and RepoCoder.In our experiments,  
    we use a sparse bag-of-words model as their  
       retriever, which calculates text similarity us-  
       ing the Jaccard index and achieves equivalent  
       performance to the dense retriever. The line  
       length of the sliding window and the sliding  
       size are set to 20 and 10, respectively. Accord-  
       ing to the maximum input length of code LMs,  
       the maximum number of the retrieved code  
       snippets in prompts is set to 40 for the Star-  
       Coder model and 10 for other models. The  
       number of iterations of RepoCoder is set to 2\.

\`\`\`  
C.3 Details of Used LMs  
We categorize the used LMs into specialized code  
LMs, adapted code LMs, and GPT models. The

\`\`\`  
details are listed as follows:  
\`\`\`  
\- CodeGen(Nijkamp et al., 2023a,b) is a family  
    of auto-regressive LMs for program synthesis.  
We use the CodeGen2.5 model with 7B pa-  
rameters and the CodeGen models with 350M,  
2.7B, 6.1B, and 16.1B parameters, which sup-  
port a maximum context length of 2,048 (2K)  
tokens. We use their mono versions, which are  
further trained on additional Python tokens.  
\- SantaCoder(Allal et al., 2023\) is a code  
    model with 1.1B parameters, which supports  
    a maximum context length of 2K tokens.  
\- StarCoder(Li et al., 2023b) is a 15.5B model  
    trained on 80+ programming languages and  
    further trained on Python, which supports a  
    maximum context length of 8K tokens.  
\- Code Llama(Rozière et al., 2023\) is created  
    by further training Llama 2 (Touvron et al.,  
    2023\) on its code-specific datasets, which sup-  
    ports a maximum context length of 16k tokens.  
    Considering GPU member and efficiency, we  
    chose the 7B Python specialist version named  
    CodeLlama-7b-Python-hf and limit the maxi-  
    mum context length to 8K tokens.  
\- GPT models(Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI,  
    2023\) are commercial black box models re-  
    leased by OpenAI. The used API of GPT-3.

is gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 with a maximum con-  
text length of 4K tokens. The used API of  
GPT-4 is gpt-4-0613 with a maximum context  
length of 8K tokens.  
The analysis experiments with Code LLama  
and GPT models may suffer from data leakage  
issues. As mentioned in Appendix C.1, both Cross-  
CodeEval and our ReccEval devote effort to col-  
lecting projects (e.g., released between 2023-01-  
to 2023-04-28 for ReccEval) that are not in pre-  
training corpora. However, Code Llama is trained  
on unknown datasets between January 2023 and  
July 2023, and the training data of GPT models is  
unknown and updated.  
We set the temperature of these LMs as 0 to  
obtain deterministic results. The maximum genera-  
tion length is set to 48 tokens, which is long enough  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
to accomplish line completions. An exception is  
RG-1, which asks LMs to generate 100 tokens since  
RepoCoder requires sufficient content for further re-  
trieval. We run StarCoder-15.5B, CodeGen-16.1B,  
and Code Llama-7B on an NVIDIA A800 with  
80GB memory and run other LMs on an NVIDIA  
GeForce RTX 4090 with 24GB memory.  
The instruction of GPT models is “You are a  
Python expert. Please complete the last line of the  
following Python code:”. For RG-1, the instruction  
is “You are a Python expert. Please complete the  
following Python code:”. We set line feed as the  
stop token of LM generation, except for RG-1 (still  
100 tokens).

C.4 Details of Evaluation Metrics  
\`\`\`  
\- Code match.Given a predictionyand the ref-  
    erencey∗, we assessyusing the exact match  
    accuracy (EM) and the Levenshtein edit sim-  
    ilarity (ES) (Lu et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,  
    2023). EM is calculated by an indicator func-  
    tion whose value is 1 ify=y∗; otherwise, it  
    is 0 .ES= 1− Lev(y,y

\`\`\`  
∗)  
max(||y||,||y∗||), where||·||cal-  
culates the string length andLev()calculates  
the Levenshtein distance.  
\`\`\`  
\- Identifier match. Identifier exact match  
    (ID.EM) and F1-score test the model’s ability  
    to predict the correct APIs (Ding et al., 2023).  
We parse the code to extract the identifiers  
fromyandy∗and get two ordered identifier  
lists. ID.EM is calculated by an indicator func-  
tion whose value is 1 if their elements are the  
same and in the same order; otherwise, it is  
0\. Then, we transform the lists into two sets  
(without repeated elements and unordered),  
which can be used to calculate the precision,  
recall, and F1-score, where F1-score is a com-  
bination of precision and recall.  
\- Prompt generation time.To evaluate the ef-  
    ficiency of code completion, we record the  
    prompt generation time, which contains the  
    time to retrieve relevant context and the time  
    to assemble final prompts. Note that we ig-  
    nore the time spent by code LMs in generating  
    predictions, which is determined by the used  
    LMs rather than the methods.

\`\`\`  
CodeGen models in Tables 9 and 10\. The addi-  
tional results show consistent conclusions on per-  
formance comparisons in the main paper. Under  
the same architecture of the CodeGen-\* models,  
the performance of all methods improves as the  
model parameters increase. Moreover, the improve-  
ment ofDRACOfor zero-shot code LMs increases  
as the model’s capability grows. It indicates that  
stronger LMs can better utilize the relevant back-  
ground knowledge retrieved by DRACO.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
D.2 More Efficiency Evaluation Results  
\`\`\`  
We also record the time spent on indexing the  
repositories of CrossCodeEval and ReccEval, as  
shown in Table 11\. It is an offline preprocessing in  
RAG, which indicates the time required to activate  
a method. CCFinder andDRACObuild retrieval  
databases by statically parsing code files, which are  
independent of the used code LMs. RG-1 and Re-

\`\`\`  
poCoder need to tokenize the code snippets within  
a sliding window, which requires the tokenizers of  
used LMs. Note that the tokenizers of CodeGen-\*  
models are the same.DRACOis 3–6 times faster  
than RepoCoder in preprocessing time. As the size  
of the repository increases, the preprocessing time  
grows linearly. Therefore, RG-1 and RepoCoder  
may suffer from scalability challenges.  
The prompt generation time of each method us-  
ing other code LMs is shown in Tables 12 and 13,  
which show consistent conclusions with the main  
paper. For the methods with one retrieval, only the  
tokenizers have a subtle effect on efficiency when  
different models are employed. As a result, the  
prompt generation time using different CodeGen-\*  
models is the same for CCFinder, RG-1, as well as  
DRACO. RepoCoder relies on RG-1 to generate  
sufficient content for the second retrieval, where the  
efficiency mainly depends on the generation time of  
code LMs. In general, the generation efficiency of  
RepoCoder decreases as the model parameters in-  
crease. Its average prompt generation time is more  
than 3 seconds on the most efficient SantaCoder  
model, which far exceeds the time spent by other  
retrieval-augmented methods. Note that the archi-  
tectures of code LMs also matter in efficiency, e.g.,  
SantaCoder-1.1B is faster than CodeGen-350M.  
The A800 GPU used to run the StarCoder-15.5B  
and CodeGen-16.1B models is superior to the RTX  
4090 GPU used for the other models, so these are

D.3 Effect of Other Import Statements  
\`\`\`  
As described in Section 3.4,DRACOincludes as  
many otherimportstatements that are not directly  
relevant as possible. To analyze the effect of other  
importstatements, we implement a variant of  
DRACOfor comparison, which adds the entities  
from other localimportstatements only when the  
primary prompt is empty. The experimental re-  
sults are shown in Table 14.DRACOconsistently  
outperforms this variant, especially on StarCoder-  
15.5B, which has capability to understand longer  
code context.

D.4 Evaluation of Multi-Line Completion  
\`\`\`  
AlthoughDRACOis designed for the code com-  
pletion of currently edited line, it can help with

\`\`\`  
multi-line completion to some extent.  
We begin by discussing the benchmarks with  
multi-line completion targets in code repositories.  
The input code of the function completion dataset  
in RepoEval (Zhang et al., 2023\) is truncated for  
text similarity-based retrieval, which cannot be  
parsed to get import information. Other bench-  
marks (Yu et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024\) are con-  
structed for function-level code generation, which  
aims to generate code based on natural language de-  
scriptions, as distinct from code completion. Since  
there is no available dataset for multi-line comple-  
tion, we create a "multi-line" variant of the Cross-  
CodeEval dataset (Ding et al., 2023\) by expanding  
the references to three non-empty lines. In ad-  
dition to the baselines, we evaluate two variants  
ofDRACOincluding “w/o dataflow” as described  
in Section 5.3 and “w/ steps”, which completes  
the unfinished code line by line (i.e., three times  
“retrieval-then-generation"). The maximum genera-  
tion length of LMs is increased to 100 tokens.  
The experimental results with SantaCoder and  
CodeGen25 models shown in Table 15 reveal that:  
(i)DRACOstill delivers a significant improvement  
to the zero-shot setting, and dataflow analysis plays  
a positive role. As discussed in the Limitations sec-  
tion, unclear code intent in multi-line completion  
would hurt the accuracy and weaken the guidance  
of dataflow analysis. (ii) RepoCoder iteratively re-  
trieves similar code snippets in the repository to  
narrow the gap with the intended completion target,  
which is slightly better thanDRACObut still strug-

gles with multi-line code completion. (iii) Com-  
pleting line by line is not as effective as complet-  
ing it all at once. The intermediate generated line  
may not point to cross-file imports in the dataflow,  
which would weaken the relevance of the retrieved  
content. In addition, progressive completion may  
lead to error accumulation. Note that the abnormal  
results of “w/ step” with SantaCoder are attributed  
to the model itself, which usually generates a com-  
ment or another function definition when complet-  
ing a new line.  
Recent empirical studies have shown that the  
completion of currently edited statement is more  
commonly used and more acceptable (Barke et al.,  
2023; Wang et al., 2023). In contrast, long and  
multi-line suggestions are usually at best dismissed  
out of hand and at worst distract the programmer  
away from their flow. Based on this practical ev-  
idence, we believe that our focus on single-line  
code completion is meaningful and sufficient. Fu-  
ture work could explore taking into account the  
dynamic changes of dataflow during the decoding  
process, e.g., automatically determining when it is  
necessary to re-retrieve to update the prompt.

\#\# E Case Study

\`\`\`  
E.1 Prompt Examples  
We show the prompts generated by each method for  
the example unfinished code (see Figure 1). The  
prompts are excerpted for viewing the individual  
format, as shown in Figure 7\. It can be observed  
that the prompts generated byDRACOlook like  
natural code, which is in line with the training cor-  
pora of code LMs. The prediction result of each  
method using the CodeGen25-7B model is shown  
in Table 16, and only ourDRACOgenerates the  
correct code line.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
E.2 Study on Failed Cases  
Despite the superior performance achieved by  
DRACO, there are still many failed cases. Based  
on our observations, they are caused by three major  
reasons: (i) The definitions of completion targets  
may be truncated. Even though the correct defi-  
nition is retrieved through dataflow analysis, the  
completion target may be truncated due to the lim-  
ited input length, e.g., target member function in  
a long class definition. (ii) The used code LMs  
may be not powerful enough, which has already  
been demonstrated in Section 5.5. It is crucial for  
code LMs to capture data dependency relations  
in the provided background knowledge, where the  
prompts are usually long Python code. (iii) Unclear  
code intent may lead to wrong generation, which  
is a common sore point of code completion. For  
example, completing the first line of a new function  
is uncertain even to a programmer.  
In Listings 1, 2, and 3, we show an example  
of reasons (i) and (iii) from CrossCodeEval. The  
ground truth isgen\_begin\_reuse(input\_ids),  
while the prediction ofDRACOwith CodeGen  
isin\_beam\_search \= False. Although the mem-  
ber functiongen\_begin\_reuseis in the retrieved  
background knowledge, it is truncated to be invis-  
ible to LMs. Moreover, the comment\# Start  
generationis not clear enough for completion,  
where both gen\_begin and gen\_begin\_reuse  
look like rational choices.
