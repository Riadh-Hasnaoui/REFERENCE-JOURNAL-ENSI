\#\# Abstract

\`\`\`  
The Rust programming language presents a steep learning curve  
and significant coding challenges, making the automation of is-  
sue resolution essential for its broader adoption. Recently, LLM-  
powered code agents have shown remarkable success in resolving  
complex software engineering tasks, yet their application to Rust  
has been limited by the absence of a large-scale, repository-level  
benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a  
benchmark comprising 500 real-world, repository-level software  
engineering tasks from 34 diverse and popular Rust repositories. We  
then perform a comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench with four  
representative agents and four state-of-the-art LLMs to establish a  
foundational understanding of their capabilities and limitations in  
the Rust ecosystem.  
Our extensive study reveals that while ReAct-style agents are  
promising, i.e., resolving up to 21.2% of issues, they are limited  
by two primary challenges: comprehending repository-wide code  
structure and complying with Rust’s strict type and trait semantics.  
We also find that issue reproduction is rather critical for task reso-  
lution. Inspired by these findings, we propose RustForger, a novel  
agentic approach that integrates an automated test environment  
setup with a Rust metaprogramming-driven dynamic tracing strat-  
egy to facilitate reliable issue reproduction and dynamic analysis.  
The evaluation shows that RustForger using Claude-Sonnet-3.  
significantly outperforms all baselines, resolving 28.6% of tasks  
on Rust-SWE-bench, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest  
baseline, and, in aggregate, uniquely solves 46 tasks that no other  
agent could solve across all adopted advanced LLMs.

\#\# 1 Introduction

\`\`\`  
The Rust programming language has become increasingly popular  
by offering a compelling combination of performance and safety \[ 20 ,  
64 , 77 \]. Through its strict type system and ownership model, it  
provides compile-time guarantees against memory faults and data  
races \[ 78 \], which has led to its wide adoption in critical domains  
such as operating systems \[ 43 , 57 , 61 \], cloud services \[ 9 \], and web  
browsers \[ 32 , 49 , 80 \]. However, its core strengths, i.e., memory  
and thread safety, also cause its steep learning curve and coding  
difficulty, posing significant challenges for developers, with 83% of  
them finding it difficult to use \[ 79 \] and 42% worrying about the long  
"time to productivity" \[ 27 \]. Therefore, automating the resolution  
of the issues related to development in Rust is rather essential for  
unlocking Rust’s full potential and extending its adoption.  
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated  
powers in addressing a wide range of software engineering chal-  
lenges \[ 29 , 33 , 35 , 45 , 63 , 66 – 69 , 90 \]. Specifically, LLM code agents,  
which leverage LLMs’ coding abilities through tool adoption, com-  
mand execution, environmental feedback, and action planning,  
have demonstrated superior performance in code-related tasks \[ 13 ,  
87 , 92 \] and aided developers in coding efficiency \[ 15 , 70 \]. Their

strengths are typically exemplified by their performance on pop-  
ular benchmarks such as SWE-bench Verified \[ 33 \], a version of  
SWE-bench crafted by OpenAI \[ 54 \] for resolving real-world Python  
issues. In this benchmark, an agent, given only an issue description  
and a full repository codebase, is expected to autonomously gener-  
ate a single corrective patch to resolve the issue and pass all tests  
in one attempt. This task is highly demanding, requiring a suite of  
capabilities including repository-level code understanding, targeted  
search, issue-reproducing test generation, and precise code edit-  
ing. Surprisingly, the resolution rate on this benchmark has been  
improving dramatically, from a mere 1.2% achieved by approaches  
like RAG with SWE-Llama 13B in October 2023 \[ 33 \] to a recent  
high 80.2% achieved by agents like Claude-Tools powered by the  
Claude 4 Opus model \[13\].  
The demand for automating Rust issue resolution and the demon-  
strated power of advanced LLMs and code agents altogether raise  
a compelling question: can agentic approaches effectively automate  
the resolution of real-world Rust issues? To answer this question,  
it is essential for a large-scale, repository-level benchmark for  
real-world software engineering tasks for Rust and a comprehen-  
sive study on how advanced LLMs and agents perform on such  
tasks upon the benchmark. However, existing benchmarks for  
Rust are deficient in two key aspects. First, while existing Rust  
benchmarks focus on granular tasks such as C-to-Rust transpila-  
tion \[ 14 , 36 , 56 \], function-level code synthesis \[ 17 , 50 \], or specific  
CVE analysis \[ 52 , 59 , 91 , 101 \], they are limited in involving general,  
repository-level software engineering problems. Second, existing  
large-scale SWE benchmarks predominantly feature Python and  
Java \[ 33 , 46 , 98 \]. The few that incorporate Rust only offer a smaller  
corpus of tasks (e.g., 43 in SWE-bench Multilingual \[ 37 \] and 239 in  
Multi-SWE-bench \[ 96 \] compared with 500 Python issues in SWE-  
bench Verified \[ 54 \]). Consequently, the absence of a benchmark  
that is both large-scale and dedicated to real-world Rust software  
engineering tasks prevents us from comprehensively assessing  
the effectiveness of the LLMs and agents on resolving practical,  
repository-level Rust issues.  
To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a large-scale  
benchmark that contains 500 real-world, issue-resolving repository-  
level Rust tasks from 34 popular repositories. Specifically, we adopt  
the well-established SWE-bench workflow \[ 33 \] and adhere to the  
verification protocol established by the popular SWE-bench Ver-  
ified \[ 54 \] to construct it. Our data collection process begins by  
sourcing pull requests (PRs) from approximately 87 prominent  
open-source Rust repositories selected based on their popularity  
on GitHub (\> 1,000 stars). We then identify candidate tasks with  
PRs that are both merged and linked to a resolved GitHub issue  
and that contain modifications to test files. Finally, to ensure that  
each task represents a verifiable fix, we validate whether each patch  
induces a "fail-to-pass" transition (i.e., at least one test fails before  
the patch and passes after the patch is applied), yielding a candidate  
set of 1,040 Rust software engineering tasks. To mitigate issues  
like underspecified problem descriptions \[ 54 , 89 \] which can lead  
to the underestimation of LLM capabilities and inefficient use of  
computational resources, we perform a final manual inspection of  
task candidates, following OpenAI’s construction principles \[ 54 \].  
Eventually, we obtain 500 high-quality software engineering tasks  
for Rust from 34 diverse GitHub repositories.

\`\`\`  
To assess the capabilities of advanced LLMs and agents on this  
new benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study in-  
volving four representative agentic approaches (i.e., SWE-agent \[ 92 \],  
OpenHands+CodeAct v2.1 \[ 87 \], Agentless \[ 89 \], and AutoCodeRover  
v2.0 \[ 63 \]) and four state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., Claude-Sonnet-3.7 \[ 11 \],  
GPT-4o \[ 53 \], OpenAI o4-mini \[ 55 \], and Qwen3 \[ 10 \]). Specifically,  
these studied agents are selected for their general-purpose design,  
i.e., having demonstrated capabilities across various programming  
languages \[ 37 , 60 , 96 \]. The evaluation results demonstrate that the  
adoption of a ReAct-style \[ 93 \] (‘thought-act-observe’ loop) archi-  
tecture excels in solving tasks on Rust-SWE-bench. The associated  
agent OpenHands with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 \[ 11 \] resolves a substan-  
tial 21.2% of real-world repository-level Rust issues, for which the  
manual resolution process averages 126 days and approximately 5\.  
rounds of discussion. Moreover, we find that top-performing agents  
distinguish themselves by their ability to generate large, complex  
patches, e.g., the leading agent OpenHands resolves significantly  
more issues than Agentless (105 vs. 57\) when the required patch  
size exceeds 150 lines. We also find the compilation errors stem  
from failures to model repository-wide code structure and to comply  
with Rust’s strict type and trait semantics. Interestingly, we observe  
that issue reproduction is critical for Rust issue resolution, e.g., the  
remaining 44.5% of tasks fail at the reproduction stage and thus  
could not be successfully resolved even under the top-performing  
agent-model configuration.  
To mitigate the issues of repository-wide code analysis and issue  
reproduction in our study findings, we further introduce Rust-  
Forger, a novel agentic approach through automated test environ-  
ment setup coupled with a cross-project dynamic tracing mecha-  
nism. Specifically, RustForger first constructs an isolated testing  
workspace, managing Cargo dependencies \[ 24 \] to create a reli-  
able and sandboxed environment for issue reproduction. Within  
this controlled environment, the agent can invoke a novelTrace  
command for cross-project dynamic analysis. This command auto-  
mates the entire dynamic analysis workflow by leveraging Rust’s  
metaprogramming capabilities—specifically procedural macros—to  
automatically instrument target functions through Abstract Syn-  
tax Tree (AST) modification. Such a decoupled strategy enables  
the agent to capture precise runtime control-flow information by  
executing tests from the clean workspace, thereby bypassing the  
complex build systems of the original project. Accordingly, Rust-  
Forger equips the agent with the necessary runtime insights to  
more effectively diagnose and resolve complex real-world Rust  
issues. The evaluation results show RustForger solves 46 tasks  
that cannot be solved by any studied agent across all LLMs; its  
pairing with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 resolves 28.6% of tasks—a 34.9%  
improvement over the strongest baseline.  
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:

    a critical gap in the field and enables systematic evaluation and

\#\# 2 Background & Related Work

\#\# 2.1 Rust Programming Language

Rust offers a modern solution for high-performance and secure soft-  
ware that provides strong compile-time guarantees against memory  
faults and data races without the overhead of a garbage collector.  
This combination of safety and performance has spurred its adop-  
tion in critical domains, including operating systems such as Re-  
dox \[ 62 \] and Tock \[ 88 \], web browsers such as Servo \[ 83 \], and cloud  
infrastructure like Firecracker \[ 9 \]. Notably, Rust now constitutes  
21% of all new native code in the Android OS codebase \[42\].  
While Rust’s safety guarantees are enforced by its unique type  
system (built on ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes), such a sys-  
tem is notoriously difficult for newcomers to master, creating a  
steep learning curve and a significant barrier for adoption \[ 22 , 79 \].  
To address this high development overhead, researchers and de-  
velopers have proposed various approaches. RustAssistant \[ 23 \]  
leverages LLMs to help developers automatically fix compilation  
errors. The LLM-driven Syzygy \[ 65 \] aims to automate the migration  
of legacy C codebases to Rust. Concrat \[ 30 \] analyzes and replaces  
unsafe C lock APIs in concurrent programs with provably safe  
Rust equivalents. Bronze \[ 21 \] introduces an optional garbage col-  
lector to reduce the difficulty of complex memory management.  
PanicKiller \[ 52 \] provides the first automated tool for fixing panic  
bugs in real-world Rust programs. However, despite these special-  
ized solutions, a general-purpose agent capable of resolving diverse,  
real-world Rust issues remains an open challenge.

\#\# 2.2 Large Language Model-based Agents

\`\`\`  
LLM-based agents refer to autonomous systems that use an LLM  
as a central controller to perceive and act upon an environment to  
achieve specific goals \[ 34 , 84 \]. These agents operate in an iterative  
cycle, leveraging core components: planning for decomposing com-  
plex tasks, memory for learning from historical observations \[ 99 \],  
and perception for processing environmental feedback, as shown in  
Figure 1\. Crucially, their action component enables them to utilize  
external tools, allowing them to interact with and modify their  
environment in ways far beyond simple text generation \[84\].  
Researchers have attempted to use agents to automatically re-  
solve real-world, repository-level software engineering tasks \[ 26 ,  
33 , 37 , 60 , 95 – 97 \]. Specifically, SWE-bench \[ 33 \] has gained sig-  
nificant attention since its release, with numerous agents being

evaluated on this benchmark. In this benchmark, an agent, given  
only an issue description and the repository codebase, is expected  
to autonomously generate a single corrective patch to resolve the  
issue and pass all tests in one attempt. This task is highly demand-  
ing, requiring a suite of capabilities including repository-level code  
understanding, targeted search, issue-reproducing test generation,  
and precise code editing. Notably, reproducing an issue—whether  
a bug, a missing feature, or an API behavior—is a critical step for  
capturing dynamic execution information, which in turn facilitates  
more precise issue-related code localization and targeted patch gen-  
eration \[ 41 \] and serves as a foundational stage in recent advanced  
agents \[19, 63, 87, 89, 92\].  
To resolve the tasks mentioned above, a variety of paradigms  
have been proposed. ReAct \[ 93 \] enables an agent to synergize rea-  
soning and acting by interleaving a ‘thought-act-observe’ loop.  
For instance, SWE-agent \[ 92 \] implements the ReAct loop with  
an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) by equipping LLMs with high-  
level tools for file searching, editing, and navigation, instead of raw  
terminal interaction. Similarly, the OpenHands agent \[ 87 \], built  
upon the ReAct-style CodeAct architecture \[ 85 \], operates as a gen-  
eralist platform where agents perform tasks by executing code or  
conversing with humans for clarification. Another group of agents  
employ more structured, multi-stage workflows. For instance, Au-  
toCodeRover v2.0 \[ 63 \] utilizes a pipeline of specialized agents for  
iterative context retrieval and specification inference to guide patch  
generation. Agentless \[ 89 \] demonstrates the efficacy of a simpler,  
non-iterative workflow (e.g., localize, repair, and validate) that de-  
liberately limits the LLM’s autonomy. While these agents show  
promising results on Python-centric benchmarks like SWE-bench  
Verified (e.g., OpenHands at 70.4% and Agentless at 50.8%), their  
effectiveness on real-world Rust issues remains underexplored.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 2.3 SWE-related Benchmarks

\`\`\`  
SWE-bench \[ 33 \] is a prominent benchmark for evaluating end-to-  
end software maintenance capabilities, comprising 2,294 real-world  
tasks derived from GitHub issues across 12 popular Python reposi-  
tories. Specifically, the objective for each task is to automatically  
resolve the corresponding issue and submit a patch. The construc-  
tion of SWE-bench follows a three-stage pipeline to ensure task  
quality: (1) scraping pull requests from well-maintained reposito-  
ries, (2) filtering for those that resolve a specific issue and modify  
corresponding tests, and (3) retaining only instances that pass a  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
"fail-to-pass" execution cycle, confirming the tests’ relevance to  
the issue. In each task, an agent is provided with an issue descrip-  
tion and the entire repository as the codebase, and is challenged to  
autonomously generate a corrective code patch. A submission is  
deemed successful only if the patch successfully applies and passes  
all unit and integration tests, which are hidden from the agent  
during the resolution task. To facilitate more reliable evaluation  
and reduce evaluation overhead \[ 89 \], SWE-bench Verified provides  
a subset of 500 human-validated tasks with well-scoped tests and  
unambiguous issue descriptions \[54\].  
Recently, researchers have extended the repository-level issue-  
resolution tasks for SWE-bench in a multilingual manner. For in-  
stance, Multi-SWE-bench \[ 96 \] introduces a large-scale, human-  
annotated dataset of 1,632 tasks across seven languages, including  
Java, JavaScript, and Rust. SWE-bench Multilingual \[ 37 \] offers a  
more compact set of 300 high-quality tasks across nine languages,  
designed for rapid evaluation while maintaining full compatibility  
with the original SWE-bench infrastructure. SWE-PolyBench \[60\]  
focuses on languages like Java and TypeScript. These benchmarks  
collectively represent a significant step towards evaluating the gen-  
eralization capabilities of LLM-based agents across diverse software  
ecosystems. However, real-world Rust issues remain sparse in these  
benchmarks, featuring a small corpus of tasks (43 in SWE-bench  
Multilingual and 239 in Multi-SWE-bench vs. 500 in SWE-bench  
Verified). Hence, there is an urgent need to construct a large-scale  
Rust real-world SWE benchmark to facilitate a rigorous and sys-  
tematic evaluation of agent capabilities within the Rust ecosystem.

Figure 2: Rust-SWE-bench Construction Process  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 3.1 Benchmark Construction

\`\`\`  
Figure 2 shows a five-step construction process of Rust-SWE-bench,  
delineated as follows.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1.1 Repository selection and data scraping. We first select 87  
popular open-source Rust repositories that meet several criteria:  
they must have over 1,000 GitHub stars, be well-maintained, feature  
an extensive test suite, and possess a rich history of pull request (PR)  
discussions. Specifically, we scrape approximately 80,000 merged  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
PRs from these repositories, along with the codebase state at each  
PR’s corresponding base commit.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1.2 Attribute-based filtering. We then apply an attribute-based  
filter to the scraped PRs, retaining only those that meet two criteria:  
being explicitly linked to a GitHub issue and introducing modifica-  
tions to the project’s test suite. Specifically, we conceptually divide  
the changes within each pull request’s patch into two components:  
a test patch, which modifies the test suite, and a fix patch, which  
resolves the corresponding issue.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1.3 Execution environment construction. To ensure build repro-  
ducibility and mitigate dependency conflicts, we construct a snapshot-  
based execution environment for each task by configuring Cargo \[ 24 \]  
to use a crates.io index snapshot at the time of the original pull re-  
quest. Next, we analyze and classify dependencies as either repository-  
level or PR-specific to further minimize both storage overhead and  
the build time for each task’s Docker image and container.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1.4 Execution-based filtering. Our validation process first identi-  
fies thefailstate of tests, i.e., we apply only the PR’s test patch  
to the base commit and execute the test suite. Next, we apply the  
PR’s fix patch and re-execute the test suite to identify thepass  
state. A task is validated as a genuine fail-to-pass instance only  
if it meets three conditions: (1) at least one test exhibits a clear  
transition from fail to pass, (2) no previously passing tests (pass-  
to-pass tests) regress, and (3) the complete patch (both test and  
fix) introduces no new build failures, runtime errors, or test regres-  
sions. Specifically, unlike Python, to rigorously define afailin  
Rust’s compiled environment, we perceive compilation errors as  
test failures. This ensures that any non-compiling state, whether  
after applying the test patch or the fix patch, is correctly categorized  
as a failure. Accordingly, we obtain a pool of 1,040 candidate tasks.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
3.1.5 Manual verification. We perform a rigorous manual verifi-  
cation of each candidate task instance, inspired by SWE-bench  
Verified \[ 54 \] and Agentless \[ 89 \]. We assess each task’s quality  
across three key dimensions: (1) issue quality, i.e., ensuring the  
problem description is sufficient and unambiguous; (2) fail-to-pass  
integrity, i.e., confirming the fail-to-pass behavior is deterministic  
and non-trivial; and (3) solution leakage, i.e., verifying that the  
issue does not contain explicit solutions. Our manual inspection  
details are provided on our GitHub page \[ 3 \]. Notably, we label  
and classify each validated task by its primary type and challenge  
(as in Section 3.2). Eventually, our construction process yields the  
Rust-SWE-bench dataset, which comprises 500 high-quality tasks  
from 34 popular open-source Rust repositories, i.e., aligning with  
500 tasks in the established SWE-bench Verified \[ 54 \] for Python,  
with each task representing a well-defined and realistic software  
engineering problem.

line utilities (e.g.,ripgrep\[ 28 \],fd\[ 58 \]), development tools (e.g.,  
cargo-edit\[ 38 \],biome\[ 16 \]), concurrency and parallelism libraries  
(e.g.,tokio\[ 82 \],rayon\[ 73 \]), web frameworks (e.g.,axum\[ 81 \]), and  
specialized engines (e.g., bevy \[71\], boa \[72\]).  
Table 2 presents the overall statistics of Rust-SWE-bench, high-  
lighting its scale and task complexity. Specifically, the Rust-SWE-  
bench demonstrates significant diversity in codebase size. On aver-  
age, its projects contain 993.6 files and 128,126 lines of code, with  
the largest repository reaching over 15,000 files and 750,000 lines.  
This scale ensures that Rust-SWE-bench effectively represents a  
wide spectrum of real-world software development scenarios. More-  
over, a key characteristic of Rust-SWE-bench is the high complexity  
of its tasks, requiring an average of 9.8 files, 9.9 hunks, and 139\.  
lines of code to resolve an issue, whereas a fix in Python-based  
SWE-bench Verified \[ 54 \] requires on average 1.25 files, 2.46 hunks,

and 14.32 lines. This contrast implies Rust-SWE-bench potentially  
better reflects real-world software engineering complexities.  
To characterize the nature of the tasks, we manually classified  
all 500 instances. Figure 3 shows their distribution where 52% of the  
tasks are Bug Fix issues, followed by 27% Feature Implementation  
issues, indicating that Rust-SWE-bench mainly focuses on practical  
software maintenance and evolution workflows. The high code  
churn detailed in Table 2 (averaging 139.9 lines edited vs. 14.3 in  
SWE-bench Verified) suggests that complex code modifications are  
a common feature of routine maintenance in Rust. The benchmark  
also includes categories that are highly relevant to Rust’s ecosystem,  
e.g., API Evolution (9%) and Error Handling Refinement (5%), re-  
flecting the language’s evolving APIs and emphasis on explicit error  
management \[ 44 \]. Note that their original manual resolution takes  
on average 113 days from issue creation to PR merge and involves  
approximately 7.2 rounds of developer discussion. We further an-  
alyze the distribution of these resolution durations and find that  
14.0% of tasks are resolved within a day, 26.6% within a week, 21.6%  
within a month, and 21.8% up to six months, while 16.0% exceed  
six months. This indicates that Rust-SWE-bench covers real-world  
scenarios, spanning from quick fixes to long-standing issues.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 4 The Extensive Study

\#\# 4.1 Study Setup

\`\`\`  
4.1.1 Study Subjects. We evaluate four representative SWE agents  
including SWE-agent \[ 92 \], OpenHands+CodeAct v2.1 \[ 87 \], Agent-  
less \[ 89 \], and AutoCodeRover v2.0 \[ 63 \] on our Rust-SWE-bench  
benchmark with their details as follows.  
\`\`\`  
\- SWE-agent: SWE-agent designs an agent-computer interface  
    which defines the possible actions taken by an agent to edit code,  
    navigate the codebase, and execute tests.  
\- OpenHands+CodeAct v2.1: OpenHands utilizes the CodeAct \[ 85 \]  
    architecture, enabling it to perform tasks by executing code-based  
    actions.  
\- Agentless: Agentless introduces a structured, multi-stage work-  
    flow (e.g., localize, repair, and validate) that deliberately con-  
    strains the LLM’s autonomy to a predefined sequence.  
\- AutoCodeRover v2.0: AutoCodeRover v2.0 employs an iter-  
    ative process of context retrieval and specification inference to  
    progressively guide the generation of code patches.

\`\`\`  
4.1.2 LLMs. We adopt four advanced LLMs including Claude-  
Sonnet-3.7 (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) \[ 11 \], GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-  
11-20) \[ 53 \], OpenAI o4-mini (o4-mini-2025-04-16) \[ 55 \], and Qwen  
(qwen3-235b-a22b) \[ 10 \]. We obtain the open-source model Qwen  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
ICSE ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Jiahong Xiang†, Wenxiao He, Xihua Wang, Hongliang Tian, and Yuqun Zhang†\*  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
from Hugging Face \[ 1 \] and access Claude-Sonnet-3.7, GPT-4o, Ope-  
nAI o4-mini through the APIs provided by Anthropic \[ 12 \] and  
OpenAI \[ 2 \]. Inference for the open-source model Qwen3 is con-  
ducted on servers with 128-core 2.6GHz AMD EPYC™ ROME 7H  
CPU, 512 GiB RAM, and eight NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs, running  
Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, utilizing vllm \[40\] inference framework.  
\`\`\`  
4.1.3 Evaluation Metrics. Following prior works \[ 31 , 33 , 48 , 96 \],  
our major evaluation metric is the Resolved Rate (%), reported  
as Pass@1 efficacy. An issue is considered resolved if a single  
generated patch successfully applies to the codebase and passes all  
developer-written acceptance tests. Crucially, these acceptance tests  
are held out and not used by the agent during the patch generation  
process to ensure a fair evaluation. Moreover, we report the average  
API inference cost ($ Avg. Cost) and token usage (\# Avg. Token).  
Note that to calculate the cost of the open-source LLM Qwen3, we  
adopt the pricing model from its official API webpage \[ 10 \]. Further-  
more, to specifically evaluate the issue reproduction stage adopted  
by all our four studied agents in RQ2, we introduce an additional  
metric: Reproduction Success Rate (%), which measures the ratio  
of tasks where the agent-generated test successfully replicates the  
behavior described in the original issue.

\#\# 4.2 Implementations

4.2.1 Agent Adaptation for Rust. Following the prior work \[ 96 \], we  
adapt the prompts of our four studied agents for the Rust language.  
Moreover, agents like AutoCodeRover and Agentless include  
an issue reproduction stage. However, reproducing issues in Rust  
requires using shell commands to manage the environment and  
dependencies of Cargo projects. Therefore, we develop custom shell  
tools to enable this stage for these agents on Rust-SWE-bench. Fur-  
thermore, we adapt AutoCodeRover’s program structure-aware  
APIs from Python to Rust, enabling the agent to gather relevant  
code context. For other configurations, including decoding parame-  
ters (e.g., temperature and top-𝑝), we adhere to the original setups.  
The detailed implementations are shown in our GitHub page \[3\].

\`\`\`  
4.2.2 Evaluation of the Agent’s Reproduction Stage. To assess the  
agents’ capabilities in reproducing issues, we extract the necessary  
commands and files from their issue-resolving trajectories and re-  
execute them within a sandboxed Docker container to capture the  
execution results. Specifically, we first run the reproduction test to  
verify its syntactic validity \[ 51 , 86 \]. However, due to the complexity  
of Rust issues \[ 18 \], we cannot analyze the reproduction results  
directly via assertions as in prior work \[ 51 , 86 \]. Therefore, for tests  
meeting this criterion, we then assess the reproduction results  
via manual analysis of the test execution output (including error  
messages and exit codes) to determine if the observed behavior  
corresponds to the problem described in the original issue.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 4.3 Research Questions

We investigate the following research questions to study the effec-  
tiveness of the agentic approaches and the factors that impact their  
effectiveness on Rust-SWE-bench.

\- RQ1: How do different agents perform on Rust-SWE-bench? For  
    this RQ, we benchmark the selected agents-model configurations  
    on Rust-SWE-bench and report their overall effectiveness.  
       \- RQ2: What are the behavioral characteristics of agents resolving  
          real-world Rust issues? For this RQ, we perform a detailed behav-  
          ioral analysis of the agents, which involves examining the scope  
          of code edits, the types of compilation errors they produce, and  
          the tests they reproduce.

\#\# 4.4 Result Analysis

\`\`\`  
4.4.1 RQ1: performance of agents and models on Rust-SWE-bench.  
Table 3 presents the resolution rates for each agent-model con-  
figuration on Rust-SWE-bench. We find that agents built upon  
the ReAct paradigm \[ 93 \], such as OpenHands and SWE-agent,  
achieve the best performance on this benchmark. Specifically, the  
top-performing agent-model configuration, OpenHands paired  
with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, resolves 106 (21.2%) tasks. When resolved  
manually, these tasks typically require an average of 126 days from  
issue opening to PR merge and 5.5 rounds of discussion. Notably,  
this result largely outperforms not only the runner-up ReAct-based  
agent SWE-agent (15.0% tasks), but also the runner-up LLM with  
its own framework OpenAI o4-mini (6.8%). These results under-  
score the decisive and compounding impact of both the ReAct-style  
agentic architecture and the choice of the underlying language  
model.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 1: The adoption of a ReAct-style architecture achieves the  
best performance on Rust-SWE-bench.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Moreover, we observe a significant cost disparity among the  
agent-model configurations. The top-performing agents, Open-  
Hands and SWE-agent, are also the most expensive, e.g., costing  
$3.81 and $3.48 on average when paired with Claude-Sonnet-3.7,  
respectively. This higher cost is potentially caused by their ReAct-  
based \[ 93 \], iterative problem-solving frameworks, which lead to  
a greater number of interaction rounds and consequently higher  
token consumption compared to the more structured, single-pass  
workflows of Agentless and AutoCodeRover.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the resolved task types by all

composition in Figure 3, e.g., bug fixes (57%) and feature implemen-

Figure 5: Cumulative Resolved Tasks by Edited Lines per  
Fixed Patch, Aggregated per Agent Across All LLMs.

We further analyze the capabilities of different agents on tasks  
requiring varying edit scopes, with results aggregated across all  
models for each agent, as shown in Figure 5\. The result reveals  
that all four agents perform similarly on tasks solvable with small  
patches, e.g., OpenHands resolves 48 tasks and Agentless resolves  
a comparable 43 within a 15-line edit scope. In contrast, a clear per-  
formance gap appears as the required patch size increases. Within  
the 150-line scope, OpenHands resolves 105 tasks, while Agent-  
less resolves only 57\. Such results indicate that powerful agents  
like OpenHands and SWE-agent tend to explore a wider solution  
space by making more extensive changes.

\`\`\`  
Finding 2: While all agents are similarly effective on tasks requiring  
small patches, top-performing agents are more powerful to generate  
large, complex patches for more challenging tasks.  
\`\`\`  
We find agents frequently encounter compilation errors when  
resolving real-world Rust issues, e.g., OpenHands encounters an  
average of three compilation errors per task. We then examine

\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
the overall distribution of common compilation errors produced  
during their resolution process, detailed in Table 4\. We find that  
the compilation errors originate from two major challenges. One  
is the failure to comprehend repository-wide code organization  
(43.7%), leading to errors in naming, scoping, and path resolution  
(i.e.,E0433,E0432,E0425,E0412, andE0405). This suggests that  
agents struggle to correctly model the project’s structural con-  
text for linking different code modules, which is a prominent chal-  
lenge during the issue reproduction stage. For instance, in the case  
ofbevyengine-10627\[ 4 \] shown in Figure 6, OpenHands with  
Claude-Sonnet-3.7 attempts to construct a reproduction test to repli-  
cate a panic \[ 39 \] where cloning a reflected trait object (Box\<dyn  
Reflect\>) via theclone\_value()method erases its type informa-  
tion, causing a subsequent call toinsert\_reflectto fail. However,  
compilation errors arise from unresolved imports and undeclared  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
Figure 6: Compilation Error in bevyengine-10627 Task  
\`\`\`  
Another major challenge for compilation errors (32.6%) arises  
from Rust’s complex type and trait system. While agents often  
generate syntactically plausible code, they fail to satisfy the strict  
semantic contracts of Rust (i.e.,E0599,E0308,E0277, andE0407).  
For example, in the case ofaskama-374\[ 5 \], SWE-agent’s syn-  
tactically valid attempt to call a method on an object consistently  
triggered anE0599compilation error because the object’s type  
failed to satisfy the necessary trait bounds, indicating the agent’s  
difficulty to comply with Rust’s strict semantics.

\`\`\`  
Finding 3: Agent-generated compilation errors primarily stem from  
two key deficiencies: a failure to model repository-wide code struc-  
ture and an inability to comply with Rust’s strict type and trait  
semantics.

Reproduction Success Rate (%)  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Figure 7: Reproduction Success Rate by Agents and Models  
\`\`\`  
Motivated by Finding 3, we find that these compilation errors  
largely occur in the issue reproduction stage, e.g., 35% of them occur  
during the reproduction stage for the top-performing OpenHands-  
Claude-Sonnet-3.7 configuration, indicating that it is challenging  
for agents to reproduce issues. Figure 7 presents our evaluation  
of the issue reproduction stage, which involves re-executing tasks  
from Rust-SWE-bench and analyzing their outputs. OpenHands  
paired with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 achieves the highest reproduction  
success rate at 55.5%, i.e., the remaining 44.5% of tasks fail at the  
reproduction stage, i.e., a critical prerequisite for validating patches  
and obtaining runtime information, and thus could not be success-  
fully resolved even under the top-performing agent-model configu-  
ration. Specifically, we find that for each successfully reproduced  
issue, OpenHands with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 re-runs the reproduc-  
tion test on average 4.7 times for patch validation and dynamic  
information gathering. Moreover, we also disable the reproduc-  
tion stage in OpenHands paired with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 and find

\`\`\`  
that this causes a 42% drop in its resolution rate, indicating that  
issue reproduction is a prominent bottleneck for Rust issue resolu-  
tion. To better understand these reproduction failures, we manually  
inspect the failed instances and find that most cases stem from de-  
pendency issues (52.5%; misconfiguredCargo.tomlor workspace  
paths), followed by irrelevant tests (35.5%; tests that do not exercise  
the reported behavior) and non-compiling tests (12.0%; generated  
tests that fail to build).  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 4: Issue reproduction is critical for Rust issue resolution.

Inspired by Finding 4, we introduce RustForger, a novel agentic  
approach to enhance Rust issue resolution through automated test  
environment setup coupled with a unique dynamic tracing strategy.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 5.1 RustForger Framework

\`\`\`  
Figure 8 illustrates the framework of RustForger comprising two  
stages. In the first stage Setup Testing Workspace, the agent’s pri-  
mary objective is to create a reliable, isolated environment for  
issue reproduction. It begins by parsing the input issue description  
and performing an initial exploration of the target codebase to un-  
derstand its module structure and dependencies, adhering to the  
established practices of ReAct-style agents \[ 87 , 92 \]. Subsequently,  
the agent automatically executes three key steps: (1) it analyzes the  
project’sCargo.tomlto identify its structure and dependencies;  
(2) it initializes a new, clean Cargo project in a separate workspace;  
and (3) it imports the original, target project as a local path de-  
pendency into this new workspace. This ensures that any test will  
run against the exact code under investigation. Finally, within this  
isolated workspace, the agent generates a test case to specifically  
trigger and reproduce the failure described in the issue.  
Once the issue is successfully reproduced, the agent launches the  
second stage, Code Analysis & Patch Generation, where it leverages  
the controlled environment for dynamic analysis. After using the  
test outputs to locate potential issue-related code regions, it acti-  
vates its core cross-project dynamic tracing capability via theTrace  
command, a unified agent-computer interface that encapsulates  
the entire analysis workflow into a single, all-in-one function. This  
process is highly automated, powered by Rust metaprogramming  
features \[ 74 – 76 \]: RustForger first injects the necessary tracing  
dependencies into the test environment. It then instruments tar-  
geted functions within the original codebase by injecting tracing  
macros via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) modification. Critically,  
the test execution and data collection are launched from the test-  
ing workspace, as indicated by the dotted arrow in Figure 8\. This  
decoupled strategy allows the agent to capture precise, runtime  
control-flow information without being entangled in the original  
project’s complex build system or test suite. The collected trace  
data provides the potential path to the issue’s origin, enabling the  
agent to propose a code modification. This patch is then iteratively  
verified against the reproduction test until the issue is resolved and  
the agent outputs the final patch. Notably, RustForger’s design is  
hybrid: it prioritizes the dynamic analysis powered by theTrace  
command for reproducible issues, while utilizing the static analysis  
for all other cases, i.e., the agent bypasses dynamic analysis and

\`\`\`  
\#\# 5.2 Trace Command

\`\`\`  
In this section, we introduce theTracecommand for root cause  
analysis in complex Rust projects. It provides a programmatic in-  
terface to a cross-project tracing workflow, which automates code  
instrumentation, test execution, and runtime data collection. Specif-  
ically, the complete workflow of theTracecommand integrates  
three key components: a selective AST-based instrumentor, a robust  
tracing runtime with intelligent data serialization, and a unified  
agent-computer interface for seamless agent integration.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Selective AST-based Instrumentation. To capture execution flow  
and ensure syntactic integrity, RustForger’sTracecommand em-  
ploys a selective instrumentor that directly modifies the source  
code’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It injects tracing macros at  
specified target functions. Specifically, the process is decoupled  
from the build system, enabling instrumentation of the original  
project code while running tests in a separate, isolated workspace.  
To ensure robustness and manage complexity, our current imple-  
mentation of theTracecommand focuses on instrumenting regular  
functions, while automatically excluding more complex structures  
like closures, other procedural macros, and test functions to prevent  
potential tracing conflicts and irrelevant overhead.  
\`\`\`  
Robust Tracing Runtime. Our tracing runtime reconstructs the  
dynamic call graph by capturing function input and output. How-  
ever, this task is challenging due to Rust’s type system, in which the  
non-serializability \[ 25 \] of many types would otherwise cause com-  
pilation failures. To handle this, we adopt a hybrid tracing strategy  
that captures serializable types as JSON while recording descriptive  
placeholders for others, thereby preserving crucial type information  
without compromising build integrity. The resulting trace, encom-  
passing the call hierarchy and captured data, is structured into a  
single JSON object to facilitate programmatic analysis.

\`\`\`  
Unified Agent-Computer Interface. TheTracecommand encap-  
sulates our entire tracing workflow into a unified agent-computer  
interface, inspired by SWE-agent \[ 92 \]. The agent invokes it with  
parameters defining the target instrumentation functions, execution  
command, the testing workspace path, and the target codebase path.  
To guarantee a non-destructive operation, theTracecommand au-  
tomatically backs up the project state before instrumentation and  
restores it upon completion, usually within a second. This interface  
abstracts the underlying complexity, i.e., automating dependency

\#\# 5.3 Evaluation

\`\`\`  
5.3.1 Evaluation Metrics and Baselines. To evaluate the perfor-  
mance of RustForger, we adopt metrics used in our extensive  
study (Section 4.1.3): Resolve Rate (%), $ Avg. Cost, and Reproduc-  
tion Success Rate (%). Due to budget constraints, we follow the  
SWE-agent setup \[ 92 \] to set the budget per task to $4. We adopt  
the same four studied agents and LLMs in our previous study as  
our baselines.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
5.3.2 Implementation. RustForger is implemented as a ReAct-  
style agent \[ 93 \] and follows the setup of baseline agents \[ 63 , 87 , 92 \],  
with its temperature set to 0 to ensure the model’s output is more  
deterministic. Notably, ourTrace’s instrumentation mechanism  
is designed as a purely observational wrapper to strictly preserve  
original program semantics. To ensure identical trait resolution,  
the injected macros retain original function signatures, including  
all generics andwhereclauses. Furthermore, we adhere to Rust’s  
borrow checker by exclusively utilizing temporary, strictly-scoped  
immutable references to capture parameter values. This ensures  
that variable lifetimes and drop timings remain unaffected, with all  
macro-generated variables isolated within private internal scopes.  
Specifically,Trace’s overhead is minimal: tokens generated for  
tracing account for only 1.65% of total usage, the shared isolated  
workspace’s initial build takes about 40 seconds, and eachTrace  
invocation adds only∼12 seconds of incremental compilation. Due  
to page limits, implementation details like RustForger’s prompt,  
basic functions (e.g., string replacer) andTraceare shown in our  
GitHub page \[3\].

5.3.3 Result Analysis. Table 5 presents the evaluation results where  
RustForger, when paired with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, achieves the  
best performance on Rust-SWE-bench by successfully resolving 143  
out of 500 tasks (28.6%), outperforming the best-performing agent in

\`\`\`  
our study OpenHands with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 by 34.9%. Notably,  
theTracecommand is successfully leveraged in the resolution  
process for 71.3% of these tasks. Moreover, we validate the statisti-  
cal significance of this result using McNemar’s test \[ 47 \], a widely  
adopted statistical method for comparing paired binary outcomes  
in software engineering research. The test yields a𝑝-value\< 0\. 001  
when comparing RustForger with the runner-up OpenHands, in-  
dicating that the performance gain is statistically significant. Rust-  
Forger also consistently outperforms each baseline agent across  
all four tested LLMs. This consistent superiority underscores the  
robustness and general effectiveness of our proposed framework  
in tackling real-world Rust issues. Notably, RustForger with the  
cost-effective OpenAI o4-mini achieves a 16.4% resolution rate (  
tasks), surpassing not only all baselines using the same model but  
also the highly-regarded SWE-agent paired with the much more  
powerful Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (15.0%). Such a result indicates that by  
effectively addressing the core challenges of issue reproduction and  
runtime analysis, our approach enables even less powerful mod-  
els to achieve highly competitive results on complex real-world  
repository-level Rust tasks. At last, across all LLMs, RustForger  
uniquely resolves 46 tasks that no baselines could.

\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Figure 9: Comparison of Average Cost per Task  
\`\`\`  
In addition to its superior resolution rates, RustForger also  
demonstrates significant advantages in cost efficiency. As shown in  
Figure 9, RustForger consistently incurs lower average API costs  
than the top-performing baselines, OpenHands and SWE-agent,  
across all LLMs. For instance, when paired with the most powerful  
model Claude-Sonnet-3.7, RustForger’s average cost is $3.0, which  
is 21.3% and 13.8% lower compared to OpenHands ($3.81) and SWE-  
agent ($3.48), respectively. This gain is even more significant with  
more economical models–with OpenAI o4-mini, RustForger’s cost  
($0.6) is less than half that of OpenHands ($1.23) and amounts to  
only 28.2% of the cost of SWE-agent ($2.13).  
Moreover, we examine how task complexity, approximated by  
the original manual resolution duration, correlates with agent per-  
formance. Our analysis shows that RustForger’s success rate is  
42.9% on issues resolved within a day, 32.3% within a week, 31.5%  
within a month, 22.0% within six months, and 15.0% for issues open  
longer than six months, highlighting both RustForger’s strong  
performance and the particular difficulty of long-standing issues.  
Figure 10 shows that RustForger consistently outperforms all  
baselines in terms of reproduction success rate across all LLMs,  
achieving a 67.3% rate with Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (vs. 55.5% for Open-  
Hands) and a 45.4% rate with OpenAI o4-mini (vs. 32.6% for Open-  
Hands).

Case Study. To illustrate RustForger’s practical advantages,  
we analyze its unique resolution of issueclap-rs-2609\[ 6 \], a  
task where all baseline agents fail. The issue involves the pop-  
ularclaplibrary generating an incorrect usage string for argu-  
ments with default values. RustForger first executes its automated  
setup strategy, creating an isolated testing workspace and link-  
ing the original project as a local dependency, while other agents  
consistently fail to reproduce the issue due to the complex build  
configurations. Subsequently, the agent invokes theTracecom-  
mand to perform cross-project dynamic analysis on the functions  
responsible for usage generation as in Figure 11\. Specifically,Trace  
automates the entire workflow by: (1) setting up dependencies  
for both thetest\_workspaceand the target codebaseclap-rs;  
(2) instrumenting key functions, i.e.,mainin the test workspace,  
andget\_required\_usage\_fromandcreate\_smart\_usagein the  
clap-rssource code, with a tracing macro; (3) executing the test  
viacargo runand collecting the resulting trace information; and  
finally, (4) cleaning up all modifications. Interestingly, the trace  
data precisely expose the root cause: a faulty interaction where  
one functionget\_required\_usage\_frompasses an incorrect list  
of required arguments tocreate\_smart\_usage. This deep runtime  
insight enables the agent to correctly deduce a two-part patch  
modifying both functions. Finally, the agent iteratively validates

\`\`\`  
\#\# 5.4 Ablation Study

We further perform an ablation study on 200 randomly selected  
Rust-SWE-bench tasks, comparing the full RustForger against two  
variants: RustForger𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒, which disables theTracecommand,  
and RustForger𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒, which skips the isolated testing workspace  
entirely and directly performs the reproduction in the target code-  
base.  
Table 6 presents the results of our ablation study. First, compar-  
ing RustForger𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒with RustForger𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒, the introduction of  
the isolated testing workspace alone improves the task resolution  
performance by resolving 3.0 more tasks on average. Furthermore,  
the performance leap from RustForger𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒to the full Rust-  
Forger underscores the value of the cross-project dynamic tracing  
analysis where theTracecommand enables the agent to resolve  
an additional 5.3 tasks on average. Such results reflect the effective-  
ness of the issue reproduction and the dynamic tracing analysis of  
RustForger respectively.  
To better understand whereTracehelps, we also examine two  
representative issues. Inbevyengine/bevy-16747\[ 7 \], RustForger  
must extend theanimated\_field\!macro to support tuple structs  
(e.g.,TextColor::0) while preserving the behavior for named fields.  
By invokingTraceon the underlying implementation methods, the  
agent verifies at runtime that calls for named fields still go through  
new\_unchecked, whereas tuple indices are correctly dispatched to  
new\_tuple\_unchecked, allowing it to validate the updated macro’s  
semantics beyond static inspection. Intokio-rs/tracing-1017\[ 8 \],  
RustForger usesTraceto validate a performance optimization  
that skips Thread-Local Storage checks when no scoped dispatcher  
is active. By tracingset\_global\_defaultandwith\_defaultin  
the reproduction test, it observes that the global dispatcher is initial-  
ized before scoped guards, providing runtime evidence that the con-  
ditional bypass does not compromise correctness or thread-safety.  
These cases concretely illustrate how dynamic tracing contributes  
to the gains observed in the ablation study.

\#\# 6 Threats to Validity

\`\`\`  
Threats to internal validity. We take several measures to ensure  
the internal validity of our study. To guarantee reproducibility and  
mitigate system-level variations, we conduct each experimental  
run in a dedicated Docker container that encapsulates the exact  
repository state, toolchain, and dependencies. Furthermore, our  
Tracecommand implements a meticulous cleanup mechanism to  
remove all instrumentation artifacts after its execution, regardless  
of the outcome, ensuring our analysis introduces no residual side  
effects to the target codebase.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
To mitigate the inherent stochasticity of LLM-based agents, we  
perform our evaluation across 500 diverse instances in Rust-SWE-  
bench, ensuring the stability and generalizability of our findings.  
We set the temperature to 0 to mitigate the threat of randomness  
to the RustForger evaluation results. Potential bias in our manual  
validation is mitigated through a strict protocol where three authors  
independently verify each result before reaching a consensus.  
Threats to external validity. The primary threat to external valid-  
ity lies in the generalizability of our findings, which is closely tied  
to our evaluation dataset and the selection of compared agents. Cor-  
respondingly, we construct Rust-SWE-bench with 500 real-world,  
issue-resolving tasks sourced from 34 diverse and popular open-  
source Rust repositories. Each task is grounded in an actual merged  
pull request, ensuring the problems are authentic and representative  
of genuine software engineering challenges. Meanwhile, we select  
four recent and representative agents that demonstrate state-of-the-  
art performance on the widely-recognized SWE-bench benchmark,  
ensuring our analysis reflects the latest landscape of code agents.  
Threats to construct validity. A potential threat to construct  
validity lies in whether our evaluation metrics accurately capture  
the multifaceted nature of the issue resolution task. To mitigate this,  
we adopt the Resolved Rate (Pass@1), a widely-accepted metric for  
evaluating task completion in code generation benchmarks \[ 31 , 33 ,  
48 , 96 \]. To provide deeper diagnostic insights, we also measure the  
Reproduction Success Rate (%) \[ 94 , 100 \] to assess an agent’s ability  
to replicate the original issues.  
\`\`\`  
\#\# 7 Conclusion

\`\`\`  
In this paper, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, the large-scale, repository-  
level benchmark for real-world Rust software engineering issues,  
comprising 500 issue-resolving tasks from diverse and popular  
repositories. Our comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench reveals  
that the performance of current LLM-based agents is primarily  
hindered by challenges in repository-wide code comprehension  
and issue reproduction. To address these limitations, we design  
RustForger, a novel agentic framework integrating an automated  
testing workspace with a unique cross-project dynamic tracing  
capability. Our evaluation demonstrates that RustForger achieves  
the best performance, resolving 28.6% of the tasks using Claude-  
Sonnet-3.7, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest baseline,  
and uniquely resolving 46 issues across all adopted LLMs.
