Abstract—Code completion, a crucial task in software engi-  
neering that enhances developer productivity, has seen substantial  
improvements with the rapid advancement of large language  
models (LLMs). In recent years, retrieval-augmented generation  
(RAG) has emerged as a promising method to enhance the code  
completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant con-  
text from codebases without requiring model retraining. While  
existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on  
public repositories and benchmarks, the potential distribution  
shift between open-source and closed-source codebases presents  
unique challenges that remain unexplored. To mitigate the gap,  
we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance of  
widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-  
scale codebase of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software  
systems. Specifically, we extensively explore two main types  
of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG and similarity-  
based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B  
to 671B parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we  
employ different retrieval techniques for similarity-based RAG,  
including lexical and semantic retrieval. Based on 1,669 internal  
repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both RAG  
methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories,  
with similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2)  
the effectiveness of similarity-based RAG improves with more  
advanced retrieval techniques, where BM25 (lexical retrieval)  
and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior perfor-  
mance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval  
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complemen-  
tary strengths. Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey  
to validate the practical utility of RAG methods in real-world  
development environments.

generating entire code blocks \[1\], \[2\]. Studies have demon-  
strated that code completion tools substantially enhance de-  
veloper productivity in real-world software development \[3\],  
\[4\]. Notably, 87% of professional developers report significant  
improvements in their coding efficiency when utilizing code  
completion tools in industrial settings \[5\]. Recent advances  
in large language models (LLMs) have further transformed  
various software engineering tasks \[6\]–\[10\], demonstrating  
unprecedented capabilities in code understanding and gen-  
eration. These models have achieved particularly impressive  
performance in code completion tasks \[11\]–\[13\].  
To enhance LLMs’ performance on domain-specific tasks,  
researchers have explored Retrieval-Augmented Generation  
(RAG), which augments model inference by retrieving and in-  
corporating relevant context from the target codebase without  
requiring parameter updates \[14\], \[15\]. The emergence of RAG  
methods provides a promising approach to leverage the power-  
ful abilities of LLMs for industrial software development \[16\].  
It not only preserves the privacy of proprietary code but also  
enables models to adapt to specific coding styles. While RAG  
for code completion has shown promising results on public  
repositories and benchmarks \[17\], \[18\], the characteristics of  
closed-source codebases present unique challenges. Closed-  
source repositories often contain proprietary code patterns,  
custom frameworks, and domain-specific implementations that  
differ from open-source codebases \[19\]. The inherent differ-  
ences raise practical concerns about the applicability of RAG  
methods in proprietary settings. However, a systematic study  
of RAG for code completion in closed-source repositories re-  
mains unexplored, leaving practitioners without clear guidance  
for leveraging RAG in proprietary development environments.  
To mitigate the gap, we conduct a comprehensive investi-  
gation of RAG-based code completion in industrial settings,  
using the proprietary codebase from the WeChat Group in  
Tencent. As one of the largest social platforms with over  
1 billion monthly active users \[20\], WeChat maintains a  
sophisticated codebase with internal well-defined development  
practices and complex business logic, providing a compelling  
real-world environment for evaluating RAG methods at an

industrial scale. To enable systematic evaluation of RAG  
methods, we conduct two essential preparatory steps. First, we  
construct a carefully curated evaluation benchmark comprising  
100 examples across seven domains, with manually annotated  
context and comments that reflect real-world code completion  
scenarios. Second, we collect 1,669 internal repositories from  
WeChat’s development ecosystem as the source of the retrieval  
corpus. Following this, we propose a data preprocessing algo-  
rithm that extracts multiple pieces of context information to  
construct a fine-grained retrieval corpus \[21\], \[22\].  
Our experiments evaluate 26 open-source LLMs ranging  
from 0.5B to 671B parameters, thoroughly investigating the  
capabilities of RAG methods in closed-source scenarios.  
Specifically, we address three key research questions:  
RQ1: How do different RAG methods perform in closed-  
source code completion?This research question compares  
two types of RAG paradigms: identifier-based RAG, which  
retrieves relevant definitions of identifiers to help LLMs under-  
stand their inner logic and usage; and similarity-based RAG,  
which retrieves similar code implementations using lexical  
(BM25) and semantic (CodeBERT, UniXcoder, CoCoSoDa,  
and GTE-Qwen) retrieval techniques. Our experimental results  
demonstrate the effectiveness of both types of methods, with  
similarity-based RAG exhibiting superior performance across  
different model scales.  
RQ2: How do the retrieval techniques affect similarity-  
based RAG on code completion?We investigate the impact  
of using different query formulations (incomplete code context  
and complete code snippets) across various retrieval techniques  
within similarity-based RAG. Our experimental results reveal  
that lexical retrieval consistently shows strong performance  
across different code completion models, while the effective-  
ness of semantic retrieval scales positively with model capac-  
ity. Moreover, most retrieval techniques perform better with  
complete code snippets, whereas GTE-Qwen demonstrates  
superior performance with incomplete code context.  
RQ3: What is the relationship between different types  
of retrieval techniques in similarity-based RAG?To answer  
this research question, we first conduct a comparative analysis  
between lexical (BM25) and semantic retrieval techniques by  
examining their retrieved results. Despite achieving similar  
performance levels individually, we discover minimal overlap  
in their retrieved candidates, which suggests they capture  
fundamentally different aspects of code similarities. Building  
upon this observation, we find that combining BM25 with  
GTE-Qwen yields optimal performance across most LLMs,  
demonstrating the value of hybrid approaches in RAG-based  
code completion.

II. RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTEDCODECOMPLETION  
A. Benchmark Construction  
To comprehensively evaluate RAG’s performance in closed-  
source scenarios, we construct a function-level evaluation  
benchmark through manual annotation. The annotation process  
involves three senior developers from our group, each with  
over five years of industrial experience, following four rules:

\- Function Significance:Selected functions must be inte-  
    gral to the daily development workflow within the code-  
    base, representing real-world code completion challenges.  
\- Context Selection:Annotators manually identify relevant  
    context and documentation (including line numbers and  
    necessary explanations) based on their professional expe-  
    rience, simulating realistic code completion scenarios.  
\- Difficulty Classification:Each example is categorized  
    as either ‘easy’ or ‘hard’ based on the complexity of the  
    required completion, facilitating fine-grained analysis.  
\- Quality Assurance:All selected functions come from  
    production systems that have undergone rigorous testing  
    and are actively used in online environments. This ensures  
    their correctness and practical value. After the initial  
    annotation, all three developers perform cross-validation  
    to ensure consistency and adherence to guidelines.

After three weeks of effort, we obtain a benchmark dataset  
containing 100 examples across seven domains. These do-  
mains cover essential enterprise development scenarios, rang-  
ing from remote procedure calls (client call), coroutine (con-  
nection, colib, and encoding), data storage operations (kv),  
message queue (mq), and utility functions (utils), representing  
common patterns in the software development of WeChat.  
Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of examples across domains  
and difficulty levels.

B. Retrieval Corpus Construction

We collect 1,669 internal projects as our retrieval database  
source. These projects span multiple business units and de-  
velopment cycles, providing a comprehensive codebase for  
retrieval. To ensure data quality, we filter out duplicate code  
snippets and standardize the code format. However, construct-  
ing a retrieval corpus from closed-source C++ projects presents  
several unique challenges:

\- File Segmentation:C++ heavily relies on header files for  
    dependency management, which often contain extensive  
    object declarations and definitions \[23\]. Using entire  
    files as retrieval units would result in excessively long  
    retrieved segments. Meanwhile, applying sliding window  
    approaches to split these files would likely fragment  
    object contents and break their semantic integrity \[24\].  
\- Recursive Dependencies:Header files frequently refer-  
    ence other header files, creating recursive dependency  
    structures. This complexity prevents the direct application  
    of dependency resolution approaches used in previous  
    works \[1\], \[11\], \[13\].  
\- Auto-generated Code:Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a  
    language-agnostic data serialization format that allows  
    developers to define structured data in proto files. While  
    the protobuf compiler can automatically generate corre-  
    sponding C++ files, these generated files contain numer-  
    ous templates and predefined content that are irrelevant  
    to the actual function logic \[22\].  
\- Macro Specificity: Unlike other object-oriented lan-  
    guages such as Python and Java, C++ extensively uses  
    macro declarations, definitions, and implementations that  
    play crucial roles in code functionality. These specific  
    features require special handling during preprocessing.  
To address these challenges, we develop a fine-grained  
preprocessing algorithm that extracts relevant objects from  
our internal codebase and uses these extracted objects as the  
basic units in our retrieval corpus. This granular organization  
ensures more precise and relevant retrievals while maintaining  
the semantic integrity of the code. Algorithm 1 presents our  
solution, which addresses each challenge as follows:  
(1) To address the segmentation challenge, we extract  
class definitions and function definitions/declarations sepa-  
rately from cpp and header files, enabling fine-grained slicing  
and corpus construction. This is implemented as the main  
workflow in Algorithm 1\.  
(2) For recursive dependencies, we process all header files  
referenced in C++ source files recursively rather than only

\`\`\`  
considering first-level dependencies. This process (lines 8-  
of Algorithm 1\) ensures comprehensive dependency coverage  
while avoiding noise from unused dependencies.  
(3) To handle auto-generated code issues, we first remove  
all the cpp and header files automatically generated from  
proto files. Considering that each protobuf message directly  
corresponds to a C++ class in the generated code, we design  
a specialized functionExtractProtoMessages(lines 2-  
of Algorithm 1\) to extract message definitions directly from  
the more concise and structured protobuf files.  
(4) For macro-specific features, we extract macro-related  
definitions and declarations from both cpp and header files,  
transforming them into function-like structures through pattern  
conversion. This transformation process is handled in lines 21-  
25 of Algorithm 1\.  
Specifically, a comprehensive retrieval corpus can be con-  
structed from multiple C++ projects. The extraction process  
operates on both C++ source files (.cpp) and header files  
(.h), systematically identifying and extracting three types  
\`\`\`

of background knowledge. The set Fdef encompasses all  
function definitions, and the setFdecrepresents all function  
declarations, including both member functions and standalone  
functions. The setCcontains all class definitions existing in  
the codebase, representing the object-oriented structure of the  
system. The extraction process also operates on protobuf files  
(.proto). The setMconsists of protobuf message definitions,  
which are particularly important as they define the data struc-  
tures used for communication and serialization.

C. Identifier-based RAG

Identifier-based retrieval-augmented generation aims to en-  
hance code completion performance by incorporating the  
knowledge of relevant class, function, and protobuf message  
from the retrieval corpus. This section details the three main  
steps of this method: (1) index creation, (2) identifier extrac-  
tion, and (3) prompt construction and code completion.

1\) Index Creation:To facilitate efficient retrieval, we con-  
struct an indexed codebase that enables quick lookup of  
background knowledge based on the identifier and search type:

\`\`\`  
backgroundknowledge=Lookup(identifier,type) (1)  
\`\`\`  
ThisLookupfunction provides a service to access the back-  
ground knowledge of specific objects, whereidentifierrefers  
to a string that uniquely identifies objects, such as the protobuf  
message name, class name, or function name. Type represents  
the search type, including protobuf message definition, func-  
tion declaration, function definition, and class definition.

2\) Identifier Extraction:The second step leverages a pow-  
erful LLM to analyze the current code snippet and identify rel-  
evant and important references that require definition lookup.  
Through carefully designed prompts, the LLM understands the  
code context and extracts three sets of identifiers:

\`\`\`  
Mreq,Freq,Creq=NeedToLookup(currentcode) (2)  
\`\`\`  
whereMreqrepresents required protobuf message definitions,  
Freqrepresents required function definitions and declarations,  
andCreqrepresents required class definitions. Once the re-  
quired references are identified, the corresponding background  
knowledge can be retrieved from the indexed codebases.

3\) Prompt Construction and Code Completion: The final  
step involves constructing specialized prompts for different  
types of background knowledge and finishing code comple-  
tions. The process is formalized as:

\`\`\`  
generatedcode=LLM(prompttemplatetype,  
knowledgetype,  
currentcode)  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# (3)

wheretypehas the same choices in Section II-B. In detail,  
we develop four distinct prompt templates to help LLMs  
understand different types of background knowledge.

\`\`\`  
D. Similarity-based RAG  
Similarity-based retrieval augmented generation improves  
the performance of LLMs on code completion by providing  
code snippets similar to the current code. This process also  
includes three main steps: (1) index creation, (2) similar code  
retrieval, and (3) prompt construction and code completion.  
1\) Index Creation:Given that our primary focus is function  
completion, we only utilize function definitions as the retrieval  
source for the similarity-based RAG method. The construction  
of the retrieval corpus depends on the chosen similarity-based  
retrieval technique. The indexing process of lexical retrieval  
is shown as follows:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
{(termi,tfi,idfi)|termi∈Fdef}→lexicalindex (4)  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
wheretfirepresents the term frequency andidfirepresents  
the inverse document frequency of each term in the corpus.  
The indexing process of semantic retrieval is formalized as:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
{encode(f)|f∈Fdef}→semanticindex (5)  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
where each function is encoded into a fixed-dimensional  
embedding space and stored in a vector database for efficient  
semantic search.  
2\) Similar Code Retrieval: In this step, the current code  
snippet serves as a query to retrieve similar code from the  
previously constructed retrieval corpus. The specific retrieval  
process depends on the chosen retrieval technique.  
For lexical retrieval, the term frequencies of the current code  
are calculated, and the similarity is then computed based on  
the TF-IDF weights:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
similarcode=argmaxf∈Fdef  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# X

\`\`\`  
term∈query  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
TF-IDF(term,f)  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
(6)  
For semantic retrieval, the current code is first encoded into  
an embedding with the same dimensionality as those in the  
retrieval corpus. The similarity is then measured using cosine  
similarity:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
similarcode=argmaxf∈Fdefcos(encode(query),  
encode(f))  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# (7)

\`\`\`  
3\) Prompt Construction and Code Completion:In this step,  
similar code snippets are integrated into the input of LLMs by  
prompt construction. Specifically, the retrieved similar code  
snippets are directly concatenated with the current code to  
construct the prompt:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
generatedcode=LLM(prompttemplatesimilar,  
similarcode⊕currentcode)  
(8)  
where⊕represents the concatenation operation. In the prompt  
template, we encourage LLMs to complete the current code  
according to the similar code snippets.  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# III. EXPERIMENTSTUDYSETUP

A. Similarity-based Retrieval Techniques

In our experimental evaluation, we employ five distinct  
similarity-based retrieval techniques, including one lexical  
technique (i.e., BM25 \[25\]) and four semantic techniques (i.e.,  
CodeBERT \[26\], UniXcoder \[27\], CoCoSoDa \[28\], and GTE-  
Qwen \[29\]):  
BM25\[25\] extends the basic TF-IDF approach by incor-  
porating document length normalization and non-linear term  
frequency scaling. In our implementation, we use BM25 to  
retrieve similar code snippets from a function corpus F.  
For a given code query, BM25 first tokenizes it into terms  
{t 1 ,t 2 ,...,tn}and computes a relevance score for each func-  
tionf∈Fas:

\`\`\`  
Score(query,f) \=

\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
i=  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
(IDFi·TFmod(ti,f)) (9)  
\`\`\`  
The IDF component is calculated similarly to the standard  
TF-IDF approach, but with smoothing factors:

\`\`\`  
IDFi=log  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
N−dfi+ 0\. 5

whereNis the total number of functions in the corpus anddfi  
is the number of functions containing termti. The modified  
term frequency componentTFmodintroduces saturation and  
length normalization:

wheretfiis the frequency of termtiin functionf,lenfis the  
length of functionf, andlenavgis the average function length  
in the corpus. Parametersk and bcontrol term frequency  
scaling and length normalization, respectively.  
CodeBERT\[26\] is built upon the RoBERTa-base and pre-  
trained on both natural language and programming language  
corpus. It employs two types of objective modeling tasks,  
including Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Replaced  
Token Detection (RTD), which enables the model to learn  
general representations.  
UniXcoder \[27\] is pre-trained using three objectives:  
masked language modeling, unidirectional language modeling,  
and denoising tasks. Additionally, UniXcoder incorporates two  
pre-training strategies: (1) a multi-modal contrastive learning  
approach that leverages Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to en-  
hance code representations, and (2) a cross-modal generation  
task utilizing code comments to align embeddings across  
different programming languages.  
CoCoSoDa\[28\], which has the same architecture as UniX-  
coder, enhances code representation through momentum con-  
trastive learning. Specifically, the model employs dynamic data  
augmentation and negative sampling strategies to learn more  
robust and discriminative code embeddings.  
GTE-Qwen \[29\], a member of the GTE (General Text  
Embedding) family, is a decode-only retrieval model based  
on Qwen2 \[30\]. Different from the general Qwen model,

\`\`\`  
GTE-Qwen incorporates bidirectional attention mechanisms  
to enrich contextual representations, making it particularly  
effective for multilingual understanding and retrieval tasks. We  
utilize GTE-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct in our experiment.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
B. Large Language Models  
To comprehensively evaluate code generation capabilities  
across different model scales, we conduct experiments with 26  
open-source LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 671B parameters.  
Our evaluation encompasses both code-specialized LLMs  
and general-purpose LLMs. For code-specialized models, we  
select several prominent and emerging model series, including  
Qwen-Coder \[31\], Deepseek-Coder \[32\], \[33\], CodeLlama  
\[34\], Yi-Coder \[35\], OpenCoder \[36\], and Codestral \[37\]. For  
each series, we incorporate their latest versions across different  
parameter scales to ensure comprehensive coverage. To com-  
plement our evaluation and fill the gaps in model scale cov-  
erage, we also include several general-purpose LLMs, namely

C. Metrics  
CodeBLEU (CB)\[43\] extends the BLEU metric \[44\] by  
incorporating additional factors to capture the structural and  
semantic aspects of code. Specifically, CodeBLEU is formally  
defined as a weighted combination of four factors:  
CodeBLEU=α·N-grammatch+β·N-gramweighted+  
γ·SimilarityAST+δ·SimilarityDF  
(12)  
whereN-grammatchmeasures the overlap of code tokens  
between the generated and reference code.N-gramweighted  
applies different weights to tokens based on their importance  
in context.SimilarityAST evaluates the structural similar-  
ity by calculating the syntactic AST matching score, and  
SimilarityDFassesses the semantic equivalence through data  
flow analysis. The coefficientsα,β,γ, andδcontrol the rela-  
tive contribution of each factor, allowing for flexible adaptation  
to different evaluation scenarios. In our experiments, all four  
coefficients are set to 0.25.  
Edit Similarity (ES) measures the minimal number of  
token-level operations required to transform one string into  
another, normalized by the length of the longer string. For-  
mally, given a generated code snippetcgand its referencecr,  
the edit similarity is calculated as:  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
ES(cg,cr) \= 1−  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
EditDistance(cg,cr)  
max(|cg|,|cr|)  
\`\`\`  
\#\#\# (13)

\`\`\`  
whereEditDistance(cg,cr)refers to the Levenshtein dis-  
tance between two strings, counting the minimum number  
of single-token insertions, deletions, or substitutions needed  
to transformcg intocr. The resulting score ranges from 0  
to 1, where 1 indicates identical sequences and 0 represents  
completely different strings.  
\`\`\`

For better readability, we present the two metrics as percent-  
age scores (multiplied by 100\) in our experimental results.

D. Implementation Details

1\) Data Preprocessing: We implement the data prepro-  
cessing process following the algorithm outlined in Section  
II-B. For theExtractfunction, we employ the tree-sitter  
and s-expression pattern matching to efficiently extract the  
required patterns in constant time. Different from processing  
C++ source files and header files with tree-sitter, the protobuf  
files cannot be parsed into ASTs directly. To overcome this  
limitation, we carefully study the official protobuf documenta-  
tion and design a regular expression-based approach to extract  
Message definitions.  
For macro transformations, we develop a systematic ap-  
proach based on three key components: macro parameters,  
internal logic, and return types. The macros can be converted  
into function-like structures by using macro names as function  
names and macro parameters as function parameters. Macros  
without internal implementation logic are transformed into  
function declarations, while those with both internal logic and  
return types are converted into function definitions.  
2\) Retrieval Service: For identifier-based RAG, we im-  
plement a retrieval service that provides specific background  
knowledge based on identifiers and retrieval types. Specifi-  
cally, we adopt Tantivy^1 , an efficient full-text search engine  
library, to construct separate retrieval databases for different  
retrieval types (e.g., protobuf message definition, function  
declaration, function definition, and class definitions). Each  
identifier serves as a unique index within its correspond-  
ing database. A unified Lookup function, mentioned in  
Section II-C1, provides the interface for retrieving specific  
background knowledge. As discussed in Section II-C2, the  
Need\_To\_Lookupfunction is needed to identify the specific  
type and identifier that require background knowledge. In  
our experiments, we employ Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, due to its  
powerful ability to understand code, to extract protobuf mes-  
sages, classes, and functions that lack sufficient background  
information for accurate completion.  
For similarity-based RAG, the construction of retrieval  
databases varies depending on the specific similarity-based re-  
trieval techniques. We utilize BM25S \[45\], a recently released  
efficient BM25 library, to implement the lexical retrieval  
service. For semantic retrieval, we employ Qdrant^2 , a high-  
performance vector database, to construct and manage our  
retrieval database. The number of retrieved results is set to  
4, ensuring that the length of the constructed prompt is less  
than 2k tokens, which aligns with the context length supported  
by most LLMs.  
3\) Model Deployment and Inference Settings: All LLMs  
and their corresponding tokenizers are obtained from their  
official Hugging Face repositories and deployed using the  
vLLM framework within Docker containers on the WeChat

(^1) https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy  
(^2) https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant  
testing platform. To ensure reproducibility and consistency of  
our experimental results, we maintain consistent inference pa-  
rameters across all models, setting the temperature to 0 during  
generation. The hardware configuration for model inference  
varies according to model size: models with parameters under  
200B are tested using 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB each),  
while DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct and DeepSeek-V2.5 are  
deployed on 8 NVIDIA H20 GPUs (96GB each). For the larger  
model, DeepSeek-V3, we utilize a cluster of 16 NVIDIA H  
GPUs (96GB each) to accommodate its extensive computa-  
tional requirements. Except for DeepSeek-V3, which uses FP8,  
all other LLMs use FP16 precision for inference. To align with  
the structure format of our retrieval corpus and benchmark,  
we design our prompts in Chinese wrapped in C++ comment  
format for the closed-source code completion.

\#\#\# IV. EMPIRICALRESULTS

\`\`\`  
A. RQ1: Effectiveness of RAG  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
As shown in Table I, the experimental results demon-  
strate that different RAG methods consistently outperform  
base models across different scales. For instance, the CB/ES  
metrics of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct improve from 34.02/46.  
to 39.64/49.35 with function definition retrieval, when  
using GTE-Qwen-based RAG, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct  
achieves a CB/ES metrics improvement from 29.79/48.  
to 51.12/61.96, representing a 71.60% and 27.59% relative  
increase, respectively. This enhancement pattern can be ob-  
served in larger models as well, where DeepSeek-V3 shows  
an enhancement from 35.23/54.85 to 60.28/73.11 using GTE-  
Qwen retrieval technique, corresponding to a 71.1% and  
33.3% increase in performance metrics.  
Among the identifier-based RAG methods, function defini-  
tion retrieval consistently yields the highest performance gains.  
This is particularly evident in models like Qwen2.5-Coder-  
32B-Instruct, where function definition retrieval improves the  
base CB/ES metrics from 38.05/57.89 to 42.23/60.44, out-  
performing other background knowledge, such as message  
definition and class definition. In the similarity-based RAG,  
BM25 and GTE-Qwen-based retrieval techniques demonstrate  
superior performance, with BM25 achieving CB/ES met-  
rics of 55.67/69.18 and GTE-Qwen reaching 55.29/68.21 for  
DeepSeek-V2.5, compared to other similarity-based retrieval  
techniques like CodeBERT and UniXcoder.  
The comparative analysis between the two types of  
RAG methods reveals a clear advantage for similarity-based  
RAG. The superiority is consistently observed across differ-  
ent models and scales. For example, Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-  
Instruct achieves a maximum CB/ES metrics of 37.28/50.  
within identifier-based RAG, while similarity-based RAG  
pushes the performance to 46.69/56.04. DeepSeek-V3 reaches  
42.24/61.75 performance with identifier-based RAG but  
achieves 60.28/73.11 with similarity-based RAG, representing  
a substantial improvement of 42.7% and 18.4% respectively.

Finding 1:Both types of RAG methods can consistently  
improve code completion performance across different  
models and scales in closed-source repositories. More-  
over, compared to identifier-based RAG, similarity-based  
RAG substantially performs better in enhancing code  
completion quality.  
\`\`\`  
B. RQ2: Impact of Retrieval Techniques

The experimental results in Table II reveal that among se-  
mantic retrieval techniques, CodeBERT consistently underper-  
forms compared to UniXcoder, CoCoSoDa, and GTE-Qwen.  
This performance gap may be attributed to the differences  
in pre-training objectives: while CodeBERT relies solely on  
MLM and RTP, the other three models are specifically opti-  
mized for retrieval tasks through contrastive learning, which  
better captures code semantics and similarity relationships. An  
example is that Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct achieves CB/ES  
metrics of 51.12/61.96 with incomplete queries, still surpass-  
ing 23.23/29.54 gained by CodeBERT. Different from seman-  
tic retrieval techniques that require training, BM25, as a lexical  
retrieval technique, exhibits remarkable effectiveness through  
simple term-matching mechanisms. Our experimental results  
show that BM25-based RAG consistently achieves strong  
performance across various model scales and architectures.

\`\`\`  
In code completion tasks, only incomplete code context  
can be used as queries during retrieval, which creates a  
misalignment with the representation learning process of re-  
trieval techniques. As shown in Table II, UniXcoder and  
CoCoSoDa demonstrate superior performance with the entire  
code snippets as queries, suggesting their potential ability to  
further improve RAG performance on code completion. BM  
also shows consistent improvements when using complete  
queries across all LLMs, with CB/ES metrics increasing from  
31.43/41.25 to 36.40/43.48 in the 0.5B scale. In contrast, GTE-  
Qwen consistently demonstrates superior performance across  
different LLMs with incomplete code contexts as queries, par-  
ticularly evident in larger LLMs. For example, when applied to  
DeepSeek-V3, GTE-Qwen achieves the highest CB/ES scores  
of 60.28/73.11, surpassing other retrieval techniques. The  
powerful retrieval ability may be attributed to its architecture,  
larger scale, and strong code-specific pre-training, making it  
particularly well-suited for code completion tasks.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 2:Lexical retrieval technique consistently ex-  
hibits remarkable performance across different query for-  
mulations. While most retrieval techniques can be further  
improved by complete queries, GTE-Qwen demonstrates  
better performance with incomplete queries, making it  
particularly suitable for the code completion task.

C. RQ3: Exploration on Retreived Results

Due to the superior performance of similarity-based RAG,  
we conduct an exploratory analysis of retrieved results from  
lexical and semantic retrieval techniques. The results reveal  
minimal overlap between BM25 and semantic techniques: out  
of 100 test examples in our benchmark, there are 76, 74,  
and 64 completely distinct retrieved samples when comparing  
BM25 with UniXcoder, CoCoSoDa, and GTE-Qwen, respec-  
tively. This difference in retrieval distributions motivates us to  
explore the combination of these techniques.  
As shown in Table III, the effectiveness of combining BM  
with different semantic retrieval techniques becomes more  
pronounced as model size increases. In the 200B+ scale,  
the BM25+GTE-Qwen combination achieves CB/ES metrics  
of 63.62/75.26 for DeepSeek-V3, substantially outperform-  
ing both individual techniques. Similarly, other semantic re-  
trieval techniques also benefit from the combination of BM25.  
DeepSeek-V2.5 improves CB/ES metrics from 48.16/63.  
to 56.68/68.20 when combined with BM25. Notably, the  
advantage of BM25+GTE-Qwen combination is particularly  
striking for Qwen2.5-32B, which achieves impressive CB/ES  
scores of 63.73/72.25, rivaling or even surpassing models with  
significantly larger parameters such as DeepSeek-V2.5 and  
DeepSeek-V3. However, for smaller models (below 7B), the

\`\`\`  
combination shows limited or even negative impact, suggesting  
that the complementary benefits of hybrid retrieval methods  
are more effectively leveraged by larger models.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Finding 3:Lexical and semantic retrieval techniques ex-  
hibit distinct retrieval results distribution and demonstrate  
complementary characteristics in larger-scale models  
(7B+). With their combination, especially BM25+GTE-  
Qwen, similarity-based RAG achieves optimal perfor-  
mance in most LLMs.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
V. DISCUSSION  
A. Developer Survey  
To further validate the superior outcomes achieved by inte-  
grating lexical and semantic retrieval results within similarity-  
based RAG, we conduct a developer survey involving three  
developers from our group (excluding the authors). This study  
aims to assess the quality of code completions generated using  
various retrieval techniques in similarity-based RAG, including  
BM25, GTE-Qwen, and a combination of both. The evaluation  
is performed on a random selection of 52 examples and three  
LLMs from the Qwen, Llama, and DeepSeek families, which  
demonstrated the best performance with the combined use of  
BM25 and GTE-Qwen.

Specifically, we design an evaluation website for the study.  
The current code context and the ground truth code are  
provided as reference. The participating developers could  
assess the quality of the generated code by comparing the  
generated completion with the code context and ground truth.  
The scoring system uses a 1-5 scale, where 1 indicates  
significant differences from the original code with serious  
errors, and 5 represents near-perfect alignment with the orig-  
inal code and excellent quality. Additionally, based on our  
preliminary analysis of code completion failures, we identified  
three common issue categories that we provide as predefined  
options in the evaluation interface:code logic errors,external  
code dependencies missing, andreference to non-existent  
functions. These additional evaluation criteria help us better  
understand the root causes of low-quality code completion.

The developer survey reveals several important insights  
about different retrieval techniques and their effectiveness. The  
combination of BM25 and GTE-Qwen consistently achieves  
higher scores than using either technique alone across all three  
LLMs. This advantage is particularly evident in the win-rate  
analysis, where the combined technique outperforms single  
technique in about half of all test cases. While DeepSeek-  
V3 shows no strong preference between the retrieved results

\`\`\`  
of BM25 and GTE-Qwen individually, both Qwen2.5-32B-  
Instruct and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct perform better with GTE-  
Qwen-based RAG. The error analysis reveals a consistent  
pattern across all LLMs. Missing or Incorrect Logic dominates  
the error types at around 52%. This suggests that improv-  
ing logical reasoning capabilities should be a priority for  
future development. Llama3.3-70B-Instruct exhibits slightly  
more errors overall compared to other LLMs, but the general  
distribution of error types remains similar across all three  
LLMs.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
B. Implication of Findings  
Our findings have several important implications for the  
development and application of RAG for code completion in  
closed-source scenarios:  
Leveraging open-source LLMs with RAG for pro-  
prietary code development:Our results demonstrate that  
RAG can effectively leverage knowledge from closed-source  
codebases to improve the code completion performance of  
open-source LLMs. It is particularly valuable for proprietary  
development environments where access to extensive training  
data may be limited. The transparent and accessible nature of  
open-source models addresses privacy concerns in the devel-

opment process, making them particularly suitable for real-  
world industrial applications. Moreover, the similarity-based  
RAG proves to be a more effective solution for improving the  
performance of various LLMs compared to the identifier-based  
RAG.  
Exploring task-specific retrieval techniques:We identify  
a gap between the training and application scenarios of se-  
mantic retrieval techniques. These models are typically trained  
on complete code snippets. However, code completion tasks  
require retrieving complete code snippets based on incomplete  
code fragments. This misalignment suggests two potential di-  
rections for improvement: (1) developing specialized retrieval  
techniques optimized for incomplete queries by reducing the  
semantic distance between partial and complete code snippets,  
and (2) utilizing more powerful retrieval models like GTE-  
Qwen that naturally accommodate incomplete query scenarios  
without additional fine-tuning.  
Combining different types of retrieval techniques within  
RAG:Previous works often employ one type of retrieval tech-  
nique for initial candidate selection, followed by another type  
of retrieval technique for re-ranking \[46\]–\[48\]. Our findings  
suggest a more nuanced relationship between the two types  
of retrieval techniques. The distinct yet complementary nature  
of lexical and semantic retrieval techniques indicates poten-  
tial for further performance improvements in similarity-based  
RAG systems through their strategic combination, beyond the  
traditional retrieve-then-rerank pipeline.

C. Threats to Validity

Internal Validity.In our exploration of RAG using various  
LLMs and retrieval techniques, the performance of these  
deep learning-based models can be influenced by multiple  
factors, including parameter settings and hardware devices. To  
address this potential threat, we maintain consistency by using  
default parameter configurations across all models and set the  
temperature parameter to 0 during LLMs inference to ensure  
reproducible results.  
External Validity.Our experiments are conducted on the  
specific enterprise codebase in WeChat group, which might

\`\`\`  
exhibit distinct characteristics from other organizations’ code-  
bases. To mitigate this limitation, we select a diverse set of  
projects (total 1,669) covering different domains and develop-  
ment periods within our codebase. This dataset encompasses  
various development practices, coding standards, and business  
scenarios, providing a comprehensive representation of soft-  
ware development patterns in a closed-source environment.  
Construct Validity.We use automated metrics (CodeBLEU  
and Edit Similarity) to measure code quality, but since code  
completion tools are ultimately used by developers, these  
metrics might not fully capture the semantic correctness and  
functionality of generated code in real development scenarios.  
To address this limitation, we supplement human evaluation  
with a developer survey, categorizing potential error types and  
identifying future research directions for optimization.  
VI. RELATEDWROK  
Code completion, which aims to predict subsequent code  
elements based on the existing context, is a crucial task  
for improving developer productivity in software engineering.  
Early approaches primarily rely on statistical methods to  
implement code completion functionality \[49\]. Recently, with  
the advancement of deep learning, particularly LLMs, code  
completion has achieved superior performance in production  
environments and provide developers meaningful suggestions  
\[50\], \[51\]. Several recent works have focused on improving  
code completion through various context selection techniques.  
Liang et al. \[11\] extract dependency definitions from the  
current context and retrieve similar code snippets from a  
code repository, aggregating both to construct prompts that  
help LLMs better understand the context for code completion.  
Cheng et al. \[13\] introduce code dependencies through data  
flow graphs in a directed manner. Liu et al. \[1\] locate context  
segments relevant to code completion using structured patterns  
and implement a reranking algorithm based on decay-with-  
distance sub-graph edit distance. Additionally, Liu et al. \[52\]  
incorporate multiple static analysis methods across different  
stages of code completion to enhance the reliability of com-  
pleted code.

\#\#\# VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of  
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for code completion  
in closed-source repositories. Through comprehensive experi-  
ments on 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B  
parameters, we demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of  
both identifier-based and similarity-based RAG methods. Our  
in-depth analysis of similarity-based RAG reveals that BM  
and GTE-Qwen achieve superior performance in code comple-  
tion. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between lexical  
and semantic retrieval techniques, identifying the BM25+GTE-  
Qwen combination as the optimal improvement strategy. We  
summarize our findings and provide valuable insights for  
researchers and practitioners to apply RAG methods for code  
completion systems in their proprietary environments.
