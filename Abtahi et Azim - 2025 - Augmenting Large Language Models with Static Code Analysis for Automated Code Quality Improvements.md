Abstract—This study examined code issue detection and revi-  
sion automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)  
such as OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software  
development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects  
issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a  
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue  
was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision  
using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied  
to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and or-  
ganized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-  
augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the  
relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access  
and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM  
hallucinations—where the model generates plausible but incor-  
rect outputs—is addressed by a custom-built “Code Comparison  
App,” which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before  
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the  
static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in  
code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs,  
static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline  
the software development process, and reduce time and resource  
expenditure.

\#\#\# I. INTRODUCTION

\`\`\`  
Natural language processing (NLP) has undergone a sig-  
nificant transformation with the advent of Large Language  
Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT series. These mod-  
els excel in tasks such as text generation, translation, and  
summarization, and are characterized by their extensive pa-  
rameters and sophisticated architectures \[1\]. Their ability to  
learn complex language patterns from vast datasets enables  
the production of human-like text and a nuanced understanding  
of the context. Significant advancements have been made in  
software engineering, particularly in issue detection. Software  
issues can lead to system failures, financial losses, and security  
vulnerabilities, necessitating robust detection methods \[2\].  
Traditional issue detection, although somewhat effective, often  
fails to identify the subtle and complex issues inherent in  
modern software development. Developers frequently utilize  
static analysis tools to maintain code quality \[3\].  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
Unlike dynamic analyzers, these tools assess code without ex-  
ecuting it, thus providing faster and more predictable analysis.  
They adhere to predefined rules for style, bug detection, and  
security, alerting developers to potential issues for prompt rec-  
tification. Although manual code reviews are labor-intensive  
and prone to human error, they play a crucial role in ensuring  
code quality and maintainability. Issue detection systems are  
critical in the software development lifecycle and employ  
static analysis, dynamic analysis, and machine learning to  
identify defects early in the development process. Advanced  
systems offer real-time analysis, seamlessly integrated with  
development environments to reduce the debugging time and  
enhance efficiency. Numerous studies have highlighted the  
effectiveness of these tools for identifying vulnerabilities that  
may elude manual reviews \[4\].  
This study examines the integration of LLMs with issue de-  
tection frameworks and, explores methodologies, challenges,  
and potential improvements in code integrity assurance. The  
integration of LLMs into issue detection frameworks presents  
a promising avenue for enhancing code quality. By leveraging  
advanced capabilities of LLMs, it is possible to detect more  
intricate and context-sensitive issues that traditional methods  
can overlook. This integration could lead to the development of  
more intelligent and adaptive issue-detection systems capable  
of learning from past data and continuously improving their  
detection capabilities. Furthermore, the application of LLMs  
in this domain could facilitate a more efficient and accurate  
issue resolution, ultimately leading to more robust and secure  
software systems.  
In the following sections, a concise review of the related  
work and background is provided to establish the context for  
this study. A detailed discussion of the methodologies and the  
experimental setup employed follows this. Finally, the results  
are presented and analyzed to provide insights into current  
practices and identify potential areas for further development.

tion \[7\]. This section provides an overview of LLMs, focusing  
on scaling laws, emergent abilities, and key techniques.  
Issue detection systems utilize a combination of static and  
dynamic analyses, along with machine learning, to identify  
defects early in the development process \[4\]. Advanced sys-  
tems offer real-time analysis and seamlessly integrate with de-  
velopment environments, thus enhancing efficiency. Research  
has shown that these systems uncover vulnerabilities \[8\],  
\[9\] that might be overlooked during manual inspections \[4\].  
Static analysis tools \[10\], \[11\], in particular, play a crucial  
role in maintaining code quality by analyzing code without  
execution, providing faster results than dynamic analyzers  
\[12\]. These tools employ predefined rules to enforce coding  
standards, detect bugs \[13\], and identify security issues \[14\],  
subsequently reporting violations for developers to address.  
Large language model (LLMs) have become increasingly  
adept at generating source code in various programming lan-  
guages, significantly boosting developer productivity. Ensuring  
the quality of AI-generated code \[15\] is crucial, and static  
analysis tools are instrumental in this regard. Transformer-  
based LLMs, such as ChatGPT \[16\], can recommend code  
snippets, although the quality of these recommendations ne-  
cessitates further evaluation. The readability of code snippets  
is paramount for their effective use \[17\], with some engines  
ranking snippets based on their readability scores. Studies sug-  
gest that LLMs can enhance code-change tasks by improving  
the understanding of code modifications \[18\].  
LLM-specializing techniques, such as domain-specific fine-  
tuning, enable models to generate precise and context-aware  
responses for tasks such as code revision or test case genera-  
tion \[19\], \[15\]. Prompt engineering, which involves optimizing  
the prompts to maximize the effectiveness of the generated  
responses, is pivotal in enhancing model performance \[20\],  
\[21\]. Another key technique is retrieval-augmented generation  
(RAG), in which a language model is coupled with a retrieval  
mechanism. This approach enhances the model’s ability to  
generate accurate and contextually relevant responses by ac-  
cessing external information \[22\] before generating the final  
output. In RAG, the system first retrieves relevant documents  
\[23\] from external sources, which are then used by the model  
to produce RAG-bAsed \[24\] and additional fact-based and  
reliable answers. This technique improves both the factual  
accuracy and contextual relevance of LLMs, particularly in  
tasks that require real-time or domain-specific knowledge \[25\].  
Code review is a critical process for ensuring code integrity,  
although it is often time-consuming \[26\]. Automation of code  
reviews using neural LLM has been proposed \[27\], although  
the current models exhibit limitations. LLMs have the potential  
to improve code composition, review, and optimization \[28\]  
by leveraging their extensive knowledge of coding standards  
and best practices \[27\]. Despite this potential, the application  
of LLMs in code review and optimization remains relatively  
underexplored. Traditional code review tools frequently lack  
the depth required for actionable feedback, highlighting the  
need for LLM-based models to enrich reviews by identifying  
issues, suggesting optimization, and educating developers.

\#\#\# III. METHODOLOGY

\`\`\`  
The primary objective of this study is to automate the  
revision of project code files using advanced large language  
models (LLMs). Specialized tools for static code analysis and  
issue detection were employed to identify and extract various  
types of issues, thereby providing a foundation for automated  
code revisions.  
To automate the process of code revision systematically,  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
83  
\`\`\`

an initial analysis of the code dataset was conducted using  
an issue-detection platform. This platform performs a com-  
prehensive scan of all the code files and, analyzes each line  
to identify various types of issues. The platform categorizes  
detected issues into distinct types:bugs(unintentional errors  
introduced by developers during the coding process),code  
smells(indicators of potential structural or design problems  
that suggest the need for refactoring to enhance maintainabil-  
ity), andvulnerabilities(software flaws that present security  
risks or opportunities for potential exploitation).  
Following the identification of issues, detailed information  
such as file names, line numbers, issue descriptions, and  
suggested solutions are extracted and documented in data files  
to support subsequent processing. Properly organizing and  
processing the extracted data from the code analysis platform  
is essential for facilitating effective interaction with LLMs.  
An overview of this pipeline is shown in Fig. 1, which  
begins with a project analysis and concludes with a revised  
version of the code addressing the identified issues. There  
are two manual steps in this pipeline. The first step is ver-  
ification, in which it is assumed that no file contains test  
cases, necessitating manual verification even for the original  
files. Based on this approach, if any changes introduced by  
the contain hallucinations or errors, the next manual phase,  
correction, is activated. This phase operates in a loop and,  
requires human intervention to address any problems or issues  
generated during the LLM revision process.

A. Specializing Large Language Models

Utilizing LLMs for specific processes or tasks requires  
specialized techniques to optimize their performance. The first  
step in this process is prompt engineering, which involves  
designing and refining prompts that direct the output of a  
model. Effective prompt engineering can significantly enhance  
the response quality by providing clear context and specifying  
the expected format, tone, and content.  
After the prompt engineering phase, the next step involves  
implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG  
enhances a model’s capabilities by incorporating information  
from external sources, thereby improving the relevance and  
depth of generated responses. By retrieving pertinent data from  
databases, APIs, or knowledge repositories, the model gains  
access to up-to-date and accurate information, enabling LLM  
to generate more informed and contextually enriched outputs.  
1\) Prompt Engineering:Optimizing prompts significantly  
influences not only the length and accuracy of the responses  
but also ensures that the format closely aligns with the  
desired output. To achieve this, a prompt engineering approach  
was implemented in two steps to enhance the quality of  
the responses, thereby making them more aligned with the  
requirements. By carefully structuring prompts, the responses  
generated by the LLM are rendered more relevant, accurate,  
and well-organized, effectively addressing the specific needs  
and expectations of the task.  
The initial step involved specifying the programming lan-  
guage of the code file, such as Java or JavaScript. Subse-

\`\`\`  
quently, tasks are delineated, focusing on addressing code  
issues based on details extracted from code analysis plat-  
forms (e.g., issue lines, issue types, issue descriptions, and  
recommended solutions). These tasks were defined as distinct  
multiple tasks rather than being consolidated into a single para-  
graph, and a few-shot learning \[29\] approach was employed.  
By providing several examples within the prompt, the LLM  
model can follow the format of these examples, generating  
responses that adhere to the desired structure and fulfill the  
specified requirements. This methodology incorporates sec-  
tions for detailed instructions and specific tasks, covering three  
types of issues: bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities. Each  
type includes one example of the issue and its correspond-  
ing solution, thus enhancing the prompt’s capacity to elicit  
accurate and structured responses from LLM. Each example  
features a description of the issue, its rationale, correct format,  
and corresponding corrected code. With this refined version of  
the prompt, the retrieval-augmented generation \[30\] technique  
can be applied to further improve response quality.

prompt clearly and concisely  
10:Add relevant details to strengthen the prompt and improve  
solution effectiveness based on the retrieved data and other  
parts of prompt.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
2\) Retrieval-Augmented Generation: The second phase in  
specializing LLMs involves yielding more coherent responses  
by employing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ap-  
proach. This method incorporates an additional search step  
prior to sending the prompt to the LLM. The retrieval mecha-  
nism can vary, producing different responses based on the ex-  
ternal source utilized, such as documentation websites, search  
engines, or APIs. Through this approach, relevant information  
is retrieved from external datasets and integrated into the  
prompt before being processed by the LLM API.  
A search query, derived from the issue description and  
relevant details, is employed to extract pertinent information  
from external sources using the RAG technique. RAG is  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
84  
\`\`\`

\`\`\`  
Fig. 2\. Retrieval-Augmented Generation process  
\`\`\`  
particularly valuable for producing accurate and explainable  
responses, as it enables the model to access real-time, up-  
to-date information \[31\] and solutions for queries that may  
extend beyond its original training data. The retrieved data,  
which includes various solution approaches, were synthesized  
and evaluated. The ranking of the retrieved information and  
solutions is based on the credibility of the external sources,  
These ranked solutions are then integrated into the prompt,  
optimizing it for effective processing by the LLM. In cases  
where no relevant solutions are retrieved from external sources,  
the issue is addressed solely by using the LLM’s pre-trained  
knowledge.  
After preparing prompts using the extracted information  
from the issue analysis platform for each code file, including  
all relevant code lines, applying prompt engineering tech-  
niques, and incorporating data retrieved from external sources  
via the RAG approach, the next step is to integrate the prompt  
with LLMs. This integration allows the model to revise the  
code files based on structured and enriched prompt. The  
pipeline utilizes the most cost-effective and older LLMs for  
the first revision. For any remaining issues, a second revision  
will be conducted using the strongest available LLM to ensure  
comprehensive and accurate code refinement. Also, the process  
of using the proposed RAG approach is shown in Alg. 1\. and  
in Fig. 2\.  
One of the challenges encountered when using LLMs for  
code revision is the phenomenon of hallucinations, where  
the model generates information that appears plausible but is  
incorrect or not grounded in the provided data. Hallucinations  
can introduce new issues into the code or provide inaccurate  
fixes, thereby compromising the reliability of the revisions. To  
mitigate this, the generated responses (revised code files) from  
the LLMs were compared to the original code files using a self-  
developed application based on LLMs measure metrics. This  
application provides a visual representation of changes and  
line differences, facilitating the identification and correction  
of any nonsensical or erroneous modifications introduced by  
LLMs.  
Compared with the original code files, the evaluation of the  
generated responses was assessed using standard performance  
metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score \[32\]. These  
metrics provide valuable insights into the accuracy and ef-

\`\`\`  
fectiveness of the code revisions generated by the LLMs. The  
overall accuracy of the generated files can be determined based  
on the values of these metrics, specifically the F1-score. These  
metrics enable a quantitative assessment of how effectively  
LLMs address the detected issues and, clearly understand the  
model’s performance in the code revision process.  
If the Code Comparison App confirms that the generated  
files are free from hallucinations, they can be used as suggested  
files to improve the original code or even as replacements  
for the original code. However, if hallucinations are detected,  
the generated files undergo human review and correction as  
the final step. Once human revisions were completed, the  
files are ready for use. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the overall  
methodology aims to streamline software development cycles  
by enhancing issue detection, facilitating timely optimization,  
and automating extensive processes. The ultimate goal is to  
significantly reduce the time required to revise code files  
efficiently, thereby improving software quality and maintain-  
ability. By leveraging the LLMs, the process transforms the  
original files into reliable final revisions. The the following  
section presents and discusses, the implementation of the  
pipeline.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
IV. EXPERIMENTALSETTING  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
A. Experimental Design and Setup  
Based on the proposed methodology outlined in Fig. 1,  
the selection of appropriate tools and datasets was crucial for  
the experiment. SonarQube was selected as the platform for  
analyzing the dataset and inspecting the quality of the code  
files, as it effectively identifies and detects issues within the  
code. The dataset used in this experiment comprised various  
code files in different programming languages, allowing for  
the measurement of the effectiveness of large language models  
in this context. The LLMs utilized in this experiment were  
sourced from OpenAI\[33\].  
1\) SonarQube: SonarQube, an open-source platform de-  
veloped by SonarSource, enables continuous code-quality in-  
spection through static code analysis \[34\]. It categorizes the  
identified issues into three main types: bugs, code smells,  
and security vulnerabilities, applicable across various pro-  
gramming languages, including JavaScript. SonarQube also

\`\`\`  
implements quality gates as checkpoints to enforce the coding  
standards and quality metrics.  
An initial scan of the original dataset of the project classified  
code issues into three categories: bugs, code smells, and  
vulnerabilities. Three data files are generated for each category.  
The data files extracted from SonarQube include file names,  
locations, issue lines, SonarQube’s suggested solutions, and  
issue types. This meticulous documentation was aimed at  
enhancing response accuracy within the LLM.  
The data extracted from SonarQube was used to accurately  
identify specific code issues within particular files (docu-  
mented as “filename” in the data file), precise lines (doc-  
umented as “line” in the data file), and detailed descriptions  
(documented as “message” in the data file). Additionally, the  
type of issue (recorded as “type” in the data file) and the  
file path (recorded as “filelocation” in the data file) within  
the project were included. This information facilitates the  
recreation of files based on these paths, as listed in Table I.  
It is important to note that these data files were customized  
and explicitly modified for experimental purposes, and did not  
represent the raw data directly from SonarQube. This dataset  
forms the basis for generating prompts for communication  
with the OpenAI API.  
2\) Dataset:Project code files were employed as the pri-  
mary source for this experiment, known as the “EIS” dataset  
from Team Eagle \[35\]. Utilizing all available files from  
this project allowed for comprehensive testing across various  
programming languages and file types, including JavaScript,  
Python, Java, and Docker configuration files. This approach  
ensured the thorough exploration and analysis of diverse code  
functionalities and interactions within the project environment.  
3\) Large Language Models and API:The LLMs selected  
for this experiment were GPT-3.5 Turbo\[5\] and GPT-4o\[36\].  
The GPT-3.5 Turbo is a general-purpose, cost-effective model  
and one of the older options in the OpenAI lineup. In con-  
trast, GPT-4o represents the most recent and powerful model  
available, offering advanced capabilities that exceed those of  
the other models. The rationale behind selecting these two  
models is to leverage GPT-3.5 Turbo to revise the majority  
of files under cost-effective conditions. For unresolved issues,  
GPT-4o was employed to ensure that more complex problems  
were addressed with greater computational strength.  
In large-scale experiments utilizing LLMs, reliance on the  
graphical user interface (GUI) of the models is inadvisable;  
instead, an API should be employed. The challenge with  
the API is the lack of cached data and history of requests

\`\`\`  
and responses. To mitigate costs, it is essential to formulate  
optimal prompts that effectively elicit desired responses. This  
approach involves consolidating all the issues into a single  
file, transmitting the complete original code, and receiving the  
revised file in its original format without additional comments  
in a single API request.  
4\) Prompt Engineering :Prompt engineering is an iterative  
process that requires extensive testing to develop prompts that  
can elicit accurate responses from LLMs. In this study, more  
than 20 iterations were performed to refine the final prompt.  
Fig. 3 presents an overview of the prompt engineering process.  
The final version of the prompt includes all the relevant  
code lines, identifies specific code issues, and provides detailed  
descriptions and solutions while addressing multiple issues  
within a file. It employs few-shot learning and, features three  
revision examples for each issue type and output format. Tasks  
were divided into simpler sub-tasks to improve clarity. Data  
extracted from SonarQube, presented in Table I inform the  
final prompt format, which is used in the IV-B section and is  
outlined in detail in Algorithm 2\. The predefined system and  
user roles were integrated into the API to optimize the results.  
5\) Retrieval-Augmented Generation: The retrieval-  
augmented generation (RAG) technique enhances the quality  
of responses generated by LLMs by leveraging external  
sources such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, the SonarQube  
Community, and Google search platforms. These sources are  
highly regarded by the software development community  
for their extensive discussions on coding, debugging, and  
software engineering, offering valuable insights and technical  
data.  
In this technique, queries are constructed based on the  
descriptions of identified issues and are used to search for ex-  
ternal sources of solutions. Four external sources were utilized  
in this experiment: GitHub Community API, SonarQube Com-  
munity, and Stack Overflow. Additionally, Google’s search  
engine was used to search for broader web of issue-related  
information. The first three sources, GitHub, SonarQube, and  
Stack Overflow, were prioritized because they are dedicated  
programming libraries and documentation repositories. If no  
results were found in these primary sources, the system then  
utilized the Google Search API to retrieve information from  
the web, focusing on the top three ranked pages, where  
the likelihood of finding relevant answers was higher. The  
retrieved information was further validated by analyzing the  
source URLs and ranking the data based on the credibility of  
the source, as determined by Google’s ranking system.

through Google search. The curated data were then integrated  
into the LLM prompt to provide the model with accurate  
and contextually relevant technical information. This approach  
significantly enhances the quality and precision of a model’s  
responses. If no relevant solutions were identified through this  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process, the issue was  
revised based solely on the LLM’s pre-trained knowledge,  
ensuring the system’s ability to revise the code effectively  
even in the absence of external information. Furthermore, the  
RAG process exclusively utilizes issue descriptions to find  
solutions, ensuring that no information leakage occurs during  
the implementation of this technique.  
6\) Evaluation Metrics:A “code comparison” application  
was developed to assess the accuracy of the files generated by  
LLMs. This application facilitates a side-by-side comparison  
between the original and revised files, enabling the identifi-

\`\`\`  
cation of the differences between each file and its updated  
version. This approach simplifies the evaluation of revision  
accuracy by highlighting the variations between the original  
and revised code lines, thereby determining the viability of  
using LLMs for code file revisions. In addition, the applica-  
tion aids in detecting code hallucinations by clearly marking  
discrepancies, allowing quicker edits and revisions as the final  
step in the pipeline. The metrics used in the application,  
including precision, recall, and F1-score, collectively assessed  
the accuracy of the generated files. These metrics were used to  
assess the percentage of changes in the revised version of each  
file compared with the original version with issues. Although  
designed for classification problems, they also help to identify  
which files have more issues and a greater number of changes.  
A metric value close to 100 percent indicates fewer changes,  
where lower values indicate more extensive modifications.

B. Experiment Implementation

After preparing all the necessary tools, setting up the  
required files, and finalizing the prompt, the entire “EIS” folder  
was re-scanned using SonarQube to extract all issues. The  
initial scan identified 234 bugs, 61 vulnerability issues, and  
7,304 code smells. The project was then divided into four parts  
based on the types of issues: the first part focused on preparing  
the prompt for bug-related issues; the second part addressed  
code smell issues; the third part dealt with vulnerability issues,  
and the final part included all types of issues to enable a  
comparative analysis of the results. Each part was conducted in  
two phases: the first phase utilized the GPT-3.5 Turbo model  
and the second phase employed the GPT-4o model for the  
remaining issues.  
Before proceeding with the remaining steps of the proposed  
methodology, the experiment was divided into two parts, fol-  
lowing the extraction of issues using SonarQube. The first part  
involved utilizing RAG for code revision with LLMs, whereas  
the second part relied solely on prompt engineering without  
RAG. By separating these two approaches, a comparative  
analysis of their results was conducted, enabling the evaluation  
of the advantages associated with each method. The outcomes  
of this comparison are presented in Table III.

1\) Bug Analysis: The “EIS” folder was initially scanned,  
which revealed 234 bugs. Following the first revision using  
GPT-3.5 Turbo, a new directory, “EIS2,” was created to  
house the revised files. A subsequent SonarQube scan of the  
“EIS2” folder identified and cataloged 117 remaining bugs,  
that were documented in a data file. In the second revision, all  
remaining bugs were further refined using GPT-4o. A follow-  
up SonarQube scan confirmed that the “EIS2” folder was free  
of bugs, demonstrating a significant reduction in issues and  
ensuring the enhanced reliability of the software.  
2\) Vulnerability Analysis: The initial scan of the “EIS”  
folder identified 61 vulnerability issues. After the first revision  
using GPT-3.5 Turbo, a new directory, “EIS3,” was created to  
store the revised files. A SonarQube scan of the “EIS3” folder  
found that only two vulnerabilities remained, which were  
documented in the data file. A second revision using GPT-4o  
was performed to address the remaining vulnerability issues. A  
subsequent SonarQube scan confirmed that all vulnerabilities  
were successfully resolved, ensuring the security and integrity  
of the “EIS3” folder, thereby bolstering the system’s resilience  
against potential security threats.  
3\) Code smell Analysis: An initial analysis of the “EIS”  
folder revealed 7,304 code smell issues. The first revision,  
performed using GPT-3.5 Turbo, resulted in the revised files  
being stored in a new directory named “EIS4.” A subsequent  
SonarQube scan of the “EIS4” folder, identified 3,586 remain-  
ing code smell issues that were documented in the table format  
file. To address these issues, a second revision was conducted  
using the GPT-4o. A final SonarQube scan confirmed that  
1,367 code smell issues remained, significantly improving the  
quality and maintainability of the “EIS4” folder and thereby  
enhancing the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

\`\`\`  
4\) Comprehensive Analysis:In the final phase of the test,  
before utilizing an LLM to revise all categories of issues  
within the “EIS” folder, a comprehensive scan was conducted  
using SonarQube. The initial scan identified 7,599 issues.  
Prompts were meticulously prepared for each file based on  
these issues. For the initial revision, all files were submitted  
to the API using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, resulting in the  
creation of a revised folder labeled “EIS.Revised”.  
A follow-up scan of the “EIS.Revised” folder with Sonar-  
Qube revealed a reduction in issues to 4,340. To further  
address the remaining issues, prompts were prepared for each  
file, encompassing all identified problems. In this stage, the  
GPT-4o model was used for the revision. Upon re-scanning  
the “EIS.Revised” folder with SonarQube, the number of  
unresolved issues was further reduced to 1,058.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
C. Evaluation  
Upon completion of file revisions by LLMs, the next critical  
step is to verify the accuracy and validity of the generated files  
to ensure their usability. This was achieved using a custom-  
developed application with two primary functions. First, the  
application compares all the generated files with the original  
files, highlighting the differences between the code versions  
to facilitate the identification of changes. Second, it calculates  
and displays key evaluation metrics such as precision, recall,  
and F1-score for each file, allowing for individual file assess-  
ment. This enables faster final revisions by a human reviewer,  
thereby significantly reducing the time required to inspect  
differences and mitigate potential LLM hallucinations. The  
average values for these evaluation metrics are presented in  
Table III. Thorough validation is critical, as invalid files cannot  
be source files in production environments. The automated  
comparison and evaluation process enhances the efficiency  
and effectiveness of the verification phase, ensuring that the  
LLM-generated code meets the required standards and can  
be reliably used as a software project files. The next section  
contains all the results of this experiment.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
V. RESULTS ANDANALYSIS  
To ensure fairness and validate that GPT-4o can also address  
any issue resolved by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a separate validation  
experiment was conducted, and the results are presented in  
Table II. The findings confirm that GPT-4o, as a more ad-  
vanced model, resolves all issues handled by GPT-3.5 Turbo  
and additional issues that GPT-3.5 Turbo could not address.  
Given the higher cost of GPT-4o, a cost-efficient approach was  
adopted: GPT-3.5 Turbo was used for the initial revisions, with  
GPT-4o reserved for unresolved issues. This strategy ensures  
effective results while minimizing costs.  
The performance analysis of GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o in  
revising code issues across various categories yielded valuable  
insights into their capabilities and efficiencies. A detailed  
summary of the results is presented in Table III.  
A total of 7,599 issues were analyzed in this study and  
categorized into three groups: bugs (EIS2), vulnerabilities  
(EIS3), and code smells (EIS4). The distribution was highly

models demonstrated complete coverage in addressing bugs  
and vulnerabilities, successfully revising all 234 bug-related  
files and 61 vulnerability-related files. For code smells, GPT-  
3.5 Turbo revised 3,718 files, whereas GPT-4o addressed 2,  
files, indicating a more selective approach by GPT-4o in  
handling this category.

In addition to evaluating individual issue types, a compre-  
hensive test was conducted to assess the performance of the  
models when processing all issues within a file, regardless of  
type, in a single prompt (EIS.Revised). This approach aimed  
to compare the efficiency of handling mixed-issue prompts  
against individual issue-type processing and to examine the  
models’ ability to resolve diverse issues collectively. Through  
this method, the models resolved a total of 5,445 issues, with  
GPT-3.5 Turbo addressing 3,259 and GPT-4o resolving 2,186.  
The results are visualized in Fig. 4, which depicts the number  
of files revised by each model. In some instances, GPT-4o  
revised fewer files than GPT-3.5 Turbo, as GPT-3.5 Turbo  
effectively resolved the majority of issues, leaving only the  
remaining unresolved issues for GPT-4o to address.  
The success rates of the GPT models varied across issue  
types. For bugs (EIS2), a 50% success rate was achieved by  
GPT-3.5 Turbo, while GPT-4o demonstrated a perfect 100%  
success rate. Both models address vulnerabilities (EIS3), with  
GPT-3.5 Turbo achieving a 96.7% success rate and GPT-  
4o reaching 100%. For code smells (EIS4), success rates of  
50.9% and 61.8% were achieved using the GPT-3.5 Turbo  
and GPT-4o, respectively. GPT-4o consistently outperformed  
GPT-3.5 Turbo across all issue types. The combined efforts  
of both models resulted in impressive total success rates of  
100% for bugs and vulnerabilities, and 81.2% for code smells.  
A comprehensive approach (EIS.Revised) was employed to  
encompass all issue types. This approach revealed 7,599 issues  
across all categories. The GPT-3.5 Turbo revised files with a  
42.8% success rate, whereas GPT-4o revised with a 50.36%  
success rate. The combined effort resulted in an overall success  
rate of 71.6%. More details can be found in Fig. 5\.

A significant finding of this study is the superiority of the  
divided approach over the comprehensive approach in terms of  
accuracy and success rates. Variations in the accuracy of the  
generated files were noted across issue types and approaches,  
as shown in Fig. 6\. For the divided approach, where issues  
were addressed by type, high accuracy rates were observed:  
99.25% for vulnerabilities (EIS3), for bugs (EIS2) 98.4%,  
and 96.05% for code smells (EIS4). These results indicate  
a high level of reliability in the revisions made by the GPT  
models when issues are categorized and addressed separately.  
In contrast, when all types of issues were combined in a  
single prompt (EIS.Revised), an accuracy rate of 94.24% was  
achieved.  
As evidenced by the data in Table III, when issues were  
first divided by type and then integrated with the LLMs for  
revision, higher success rates were achieved compared to the  
approach of selecting all types of issues from a single file and  
sending them to the LL in one prompt. This divided approach  
demonstrated effectiveness in handling bugs and vulnerabili-  
ties, where 100% success rates were achieved. Although the  
comprehensive approach still yields respectable results, the  
divided approach generally provides higher accuracy, particu-  
larly for bugs and code smells. This is Shown in Figs. 5 and 6  
respectively. The difference in the success and accuracy rates  
between these approaches underscores the potential benefits of  
issue-specific targeting in automated code revision processes.

As shown in Fig. 7, the cost implications of using these  
models for code revision were analyzed for both divided  
and comprehensive approaches. In the divided approach, for  
bugs (EIS2), a total cost of $4.76 was incurred, with GPT-4o  
$3.08 being more expensive than GPT-3.5 Turbo $1.68. The  
lowest total cost was observed for vulnerabilities (EIS3) at  
$0.38, with GPT-3.5 Turbo $0.25 slightly more expensive than  
GPT-4o $0.13. The highest total cost is associated with code  
smells (EIS4) at $26.82, with GPT-4o $18.69 significantly  
more expensive than GPT-3.5 Turbo $8.13. The total cost of  
the divided approach across all issue types was to $31.96.  
In contrast, the comprehensive approach (EIS.Revised) re-  
sulted in a total cost of $25.91, with GPT-4o accounting for  
$17.86 and GPT-3.5 Turbo for $8.05. This approach proved  
to be more cost-effective overall, saving approximately 18.9%  
compared with the divided approach. However, it is important  
to note that this cost savings should be weighed against the  
potentially lower accuracy and success rates observed in the  
comprehensive approach, as discussed earlier.  
As all charts reflect the approach without applying the RAG  
technique, improved results were obtained after incorporating

the RAG and rerunning the experiment. These results clarify  
the benefits of RAG in enhancing code revision. The im-  
proved outcomes and detailed results are shown in Fig. 8\.  
As shown, the number of files that the cost-effective LLM  
(GPT-3.5 Turbo) could be increased compared to the non-  
RAG approach, and also improved the success rate for GPT-  
4o. Consequently, using RAG in this experiment enhanced the  
results of the evaluation metrics.  
In summary, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the  
GPT models in addressing various code issues, with GPT-  
4o outperforming GPT-3.5 Turbo across all categories. The  
divided approach to issue resolution is significantly more effi-  
cient than the comprehensive method, particularly for complex  
issues such as code smells. However, this efficiency comes  
at a higher cost, particularly when handling extensive code  
smells. The high F1-Score of the revised files confirms that  
these models, when used in a divided approach, are reliable  
tools for automated code revision, providing substantial time  
and resource savings in software development.  
Although the comprehensive approach is less accurate than  
the divided method, it can be advantageous in scenarios where

(RAG) across different issue types

cost-efficiency is more important than precision. By addressing  
all the issues in a single prompt, the comprehensive method  
simplifies the process, making it an attractive option for  
users to prioritize efficiency. Moreover, integrating retrieval-  
augmented generation (RAG) to enhance prompts and incor-  
porate solutions from external sources significantly increases  
the number of files revised and improves the F1-Score, leading  
to more accurate and effective revisions.

VI. LIMITATIONS ANDFUTUREWORK  
This study had several limitations that highlight opportuni-  
ties for future research and improvement.  
First, experiments were conducted exclusively using Ope-  
nAI’s GPT models. Future research should include other mod-  
els, such as Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and various  
versions of open-source LLaMA models. A comprehensive  
comparative analysis of these models will help to identify the  
most effective options for the application of automated code  
revision.  
Another critical area for improvement is the enhancement  
of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to  
optimize LLM responses. Future studies should focus on refin-  
ing prompt engineering techniques, including role-playing and  
guided responses, to generate more accurate and contextually  
relevant outputs. Additionally, fine-tuning models on unre-  
solved issues could further tailor their responses to specific

\`\`\`  
contexts, thereby increasing the precision and utility of the  
generated revisions. Integrating LLMs into CI/CD (Continuous  
Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines provides real-  
time feedback, enabling automated corrections and improving  
overall code quality. Furthermore, combining LLM generated  
revisions with automated testing frameworks can enhance the  
reliability of the code and prevent new issues from emerging.  
A notable limitation of this study was the lack of test  
cases for automated verification of the files generated by  
LLMs. Addressing this issue in future work should involve  
generating test cases for the original files using LLMs as the  
initial step. These test cases can then be used to verify the  
original files and subsequently validate the LLM-generated  
revisions. By incorporating automated test case generation,  
the manual verification step illustrated in Fig. 1 can be  
eliminated, reducing human intervention to a single step to  
address residual issues or errors after LLM revisions. This  
streamlined approach significantly enhances the efficiency and  
scalability of the pipeline.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
CONCLUSION  
This paper demonstrates the transformative potential of  
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated code revi-  
sion. GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o effectively resolved a wide  
range of code issues using prompt engineering and Retrieval-  
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, with the divided  
approach proving superior in both effectiveness and cost-  
efficiency. Although GPT-4o outperformed all categories, it  
came at a higher cost. Notably, this experiment shows that  
using LLMs to revise code issues can lead to significant time  
and cost savings in the software quality check process; for  
instance, revising over 7,500 issues took less than three hours  
and cost less than $35. Future research should explore diverse  
LLMs and advanced design patterns to specialize in LLMs.  
Integrating LLM-based systems with CI/CD pipelines of-  
fers promising opportunities for real-time code improvement.  
Overall, LLMs show immense potential in revolutionizing  
code integrity assurance and promise significant time and  
resource savings in development processes. As these technolo-  
gies advance, they become indispensable tools in maintaining  
high software quality standards.
