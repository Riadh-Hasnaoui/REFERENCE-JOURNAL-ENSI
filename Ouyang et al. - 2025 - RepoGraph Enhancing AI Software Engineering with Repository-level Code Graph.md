\#\# ABSTRACT

\`\`\`  
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code generation yet struggle with mod-  
ern AI software engineering tasks. Unlike traditional function-level or file-level  
coding tasks, AI software engineering requires not only basic coding proficiency  
but also advanced skills in managing and interacting with code repositories. How-  
ever, existing methods often overlook the need for repository-level code under-  
standing, which is crucial for accurately grasping the broader context and devel-  
oping effective solutions. On this basis, we present REPOGRAPH, a plug-in mod-  
ule that manages a repository-level structure for modern AI software engineering  
solutions. REPOGRAPHoffers the desired guidance and serves as a repository-  
wide navigation for AI software engineers. We evaluate REPOGRAPHon the  
SWE-bench by plugging it into four different methods of two lines of approaches,  
where REPOGRAPHsubstantially boosts the performance of all systems, lead-  
ing toa new state-of-the-artamong open-source frameworks. Our analyses also  
demonstrate the extensibility and flexibility of REPOGRAPHby testing on an-  
other repo-level coding benchmark, CrossCodeEval. Our code is available at

\#\# 1 INTRODUCTION

\`\`\`  
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased their powerful capabilities  
across various natural language processing tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Dubey et al.,  
2024), and now, coding-specific LLMs are emerging to tackle complex software engineering chal-  
lenges (Hou et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023), such as Code-Llama (Rozi\`ere et al., 2023\) and Star-  
Coder (Li et al., 2023a). These coding-specific LLMs are capable of assisting users with various  
software engineering tasks, even achieving human-level performance in many function-level coding  
tasks, such as program synthesis (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021), code annotation (Yao et al.,  
2019), bug fixing (Tufano et al., 2019), and code translation (Rozi\`ere et al., 2020).  
Real-world software engineering often extends beyond single function or self-contained code files.  
Applications are typically built as repositories containing multiple interdependent files, modules,  
and libraries (Bairi et al., 2024). These complex structures require a holistic understanding of the  
entire codebase to perform tasks such as code completion (Shrivastava et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023),  
feature addition (Liang et al., 2024), or issue resolving (Jimenez et al., 2024). Recent benchmarks  
like SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024\) have been proposed to evaluate LLMs on real-world GitHub  
issues. It requires LLMs to modify the repository to resolve the issue, either by fixing a bug or intro-  
ducing a new feature. This task is particularly challenging because it requires navigating complex  
code bases, understanding intricate dependencies between code files, and ensuring that changes in-  
tegrate seamlessly without introducing new issues, which highlights the difficulties in scaling from  
function-level to repository-level understanding, as expounded in Figure 1\.  
\`\`\`  
\`\`\`  
A key step in addressing repository-level tasks is to understand the structure of a repository and iden-  
tify related code. To achieve this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and its variants (Xiao et al.,

2021\) and(b) a repository-level coding problemfrom SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024).

2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Phan et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024\) have been leveraged, in a procedural  
manner, to retrieve relevant code files across the repository first, providing context for LLMs for fur-  
ther edition. However, indexing at file-level can only identify semantically similar but not genuinely  
related code snippets. Instead of using RAG, recent approaches like Agentless (Xia et al., 2024\)  
construct a skeletal format for each file, and directly prompt LLMs to identify relevant files and  
code lines. However, this method still treats code repositories as flat documents (Zhang et al., 2024),  
which suffers from limitations of repository structure such as the intricate inter-dependencies across  
files. An alternative approach is to design agent frameworks (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024),  
which enables LLMs to interact with repositories using actions. While LLM agents can freely deter-  
mine the next action based on current observations, without the grasp of global repository structures,  
they tend to focus narrowly on specific files, resulting in local optimums. Addressing these limita-  
tions requires going beyond semantic matching and developing techniques that enable a deeper un-  
derstanding of the codebase structure. This will allow LLMs to leverage fine-grained context across  
multiple files and function calls, facilitating more informed, repository-wide decision-making for  
coding tasks.

Motivated by this, we propose REPOGRAPH, aplug-inmodule designed to help LLMs-based AI  
programmers leverage the code structure ofan entire repository. REPOGRAPHis a graph structure  
and operates at the line level, offering a more fine-grained approach compared to previous file-  
level browsing methods. Each node in the graph represents a line of code, and edges represent the  
dependencies of code definitions and references. REPOGRAPHis constructed via code line parsing  
and encodes the structured representation of the entire repository. Sub-graph retrieval algorithms  
are then used to extract ego-graphs, which represent the relationships of a central node (in our case,  
specific keywords). These ego-graphs can be smoothly integrated with both procedural and agent  
frameworks, offering key clues that provide a more comprehensive context for LLMs to solve real-  
world software engineering problems.

To assess REPOGRAPH’s effectiveness and versatility as a plug-in module, we integrate it with four  
existing software engineering frameworks and evaluate its performance using SWE-bench, a recent  
benchmark for AI software engineering. Experiment results show that REPOGRAPHboosts the suc-  
cess rate of existing methods for both agent and procedural frameworks by achieving an average  
relative improvement of 32 .8%. We also test REPOGRAPHon CrossCodeEval to verify its trans-  
ferability to general coding tasks that require repository-level code understanding. Additionally, we  
systematically analyze different sub-graph retrieval algorithms and integration methods. Together  
with error analyses, we hope to shed light on future works targeting modern AI software engineering.

\#\#\#\# 2.1 LLM-BASED METHODS FORAISOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Recently, there has been a significant increase in research focused on AI-driven software engineer-  
ing, which can be broadly categorized into two primary approaches: (i) LLM agent-based frame-  
works and (ii) SWE-featured procedural frameworks. While this field has advanced rapidly, with  
most methods being released as proprietary solutions for industry applications (Cognition, 2024),  
our related work section will concentrate specifically on open-source frameworks.

LLM agent-based frameworkequips large language models (LLMs) with a set of predefined tools,  
allowing agents to iteratively and autonomously perform actions, observe feedback, and plan future  
steps (Yang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Cognition, 2024; Ouyang et al., 2024;  
Tang et al., 2025). While the exact set of tools may vary across different agent frameworks, they  
typically include capabilities such as opening, writing, or creating files, searching for code lines,  
running tests, and executing shell commands. To solve a problem, agent-based approaches involve  
multiple actions, with each subsequent turn depending on the actions taken in previous ones and the  
feedback received from the environment. For example, SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024\) facilitates  
interactions with the execution environment by designing a special agent-computer interface (ACI).  
There are various actions, including “search and navigation”, “file viewer and editor”, and “con-  
text management”. Another work, AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024), further offers fine-grained  
searching methods for LLM agents in better contexts without an execution process. Specifically,  
it supports class and function-level code search. OpenDevin (Wang et al., 2024), initiated after  
Devin (Cognition, 2024), is a community-driven platform that integrates widely used agent systems  
and benchmarks. The action space design of OpenDevin is highly flexible, requiring LLM agents to  
generate code on the fly.

SWE-featured procedural frameworkstypically follow a two-stepLocalize/Search-Editap-  
proach, as seen in existing literature (Zhang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024; Xia  
et al., 2024). Thelocalizestep focuses on identifying relevant code snippets, while theeditstep  
involves completing or revising the code. Some works introduce additional steps to further enhance  
performance, such as theSearch-Expand-Editapproach (Phan et al., 2024). Retrieval (Lewis et al.,  
2020\) is a popular technique used for localization, allowing models to search for relevant code snip-  
pets from large repositories by treating issue descriptions as queries and code snippets as indexed  
data. Some approaches use a sliding window to ensure completeness (Zhang et al., 2023). Besides,  
Agentless (Xia et al., 2024\) is a recently developed method that uses LLMs to directly identify  
relevant elements for editing within code repositories. It first recursively traverses the repository  
structure to generate a format that aligns files and folders vertically, with indents for sub-directories.  
This structure and the issue description are then input into the LLM, which performs a hierarchical  
search to identify the top-ranked suspicious files requiring further inspection or modification.

The evaluation of coding capabilities in AI sys-  
tems has traditionally focused on function-level  
or line-level assessments (Lu et al., 2021; Chen  
et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021), where indi-  
vidual code snippets or isolated functions are  
the primary units of analysis. Unlike previ-  
ous studies, SWE-bench (Jimenez et al., 2024\)  
highlights the trend of repository-level coding,  
driven by recent advances of coding-specific  
LLMs (Guo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023b). It  
reflects the growing user demand to understand  
and contribute to entire projects rather than iso-  
lated functions (Ouyang et al., 2023), as well as  
solving real-world problems in an end-to-end and automatic manner.

Long before the LLM era, the software engineering community has been studying the navigation of  
code repositories, including using eye-tracking data (Busjahn et al., 2015\) and exploring intercon-  
nections (Begel et al., 2010). Then pre-trained code LLMs incorporate repository-level information  
such as file dependencies. But tasks at the repository level often involve more intricate call relation-  
ships within their context. Recent works like RepoCoder (Zhang et al., 2023\) and RepoFuse (Liang  
et al., 2024\) have started integrating RAG modules to harness additional information from reposito-  
ries. Building on this, subsequent research has focused on embedding repository-level context into  
their methodologies. For instance, DraCo (Cheng et al., 2024\) introduces importing relationships  
between files, CodePlan maintains the code changes by LLMs with incremental dependency anal-  
ysis, while Aider (Gauthier, 2024\) employs PageRank (Page, 1999\) to identify the most significant  
contextual elements. RepoUnderstander (Ma et al., 2024\) and CodexGraph (Liu et al., 2024\) model

by effectively integrating context at the line, file, and repository levels.

\#\# 3 REPOGRAPH

This section introduces REPOGRAPH, a novel plug-in module that can be seamlessly integrated into  
existing research workflows for both agent-based and procedural frameworks. The primary goal  
of REPOGRAPHis to provide a structured way to analyze and interact with complex codebases,  
enabling detailed tracing of code dependencies, execution flow, and structural relationships across  
the repository. In the following sections, we will provide a detailed description of REPOGRAPH’s  
construction, its underlying representation, and its utility across various scenarios. The overall ar-  
chitecture is depicted in Figure 2, highlighting its key components and operational flow.

\#\#\#\# 3.1 CONSTRUCTION

Given a repository-level coding task, the first step is to carefully examine the repository structure  
so that the necessary information can be collected. The input for REPOGRAPHconstruction is a  
repository, i.e., a collection of its folders and files, while the output is a structured graph, where each  
node is a code line, and each edge represents the dependencies in between. REPOGRAPHenables  
tracing back to the root cause of the current issue and gathering dependent code context to help solve  
the problem. The construction process of REPOGRAPHcould be divided into three key steps.

Step 1: Code line parsing. We first traverse the entire repository using a top-down approach to  
identify all code files as candidates for next-step parsing. This is accomplished by filtering based on  
file extensions, retaining only those with relevant code file suffixes (e.g.,.py) while excluding other

file types (e.g.,.git orrequirements.txt), which might be noisy and irrelevant for coding tasks. For  
each code file, we utilize tree-sitter^1 to parse the code, leveraging its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)  
framework. The AST provides a tree-based representation of the abstract syntactic structure of the  
source code, enabling the identification of key elements such as functions, classes, variables, types,  
and other definitions. While recognizing these definitions is crucial, tracing their usage and refer-  
ences throughout the code is equally important. Tree-sitter facilitates this by capturing the definitions

(^1) https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-languages/

and tracking where they are utilized or referenced within the codebase. For example, in figure 2,  
we not only identify definitions likeclassModel and its inherent methods but also references like  
self.validateinputunits(). After processing each line of code with a tree-sitter, we selectively retain  
lines that involve function calls and dependency relations, discarding extraneous information. Our  
focus is primarily on thefunctionsandclasses, as these represent the core structural components of  
the code. By concentrating on these elements and their interrelationships, REPOGRAPHoptimizes  
the analysis process by excluding less significant details, such as individual variables, which tend to  
be redundant and less relevant for further processing.

Step 2: Project-dependent relation filtering.After the previous parsing step, we obtain code lines  
with calling and dependency relations. However, not all relations are useful for fixing issues. Specif-  
ically, many default and built-in function/class calls could distract from the project-related ones.  
Therefore, we additionally introduce a filtering process that excludes the repository-independent re-  
lations. Two types of such relations exist: (i)global relationrefers to Python standard and built-in  
functions and classes. (ii)local relationare introduced by third-party libraries, which are specific  
to the current code file. For global relations, we maintain a comprehensive list of methods from  
standard and built-in libraries, excluding any identified relations from this list. The list is empir-  
ically constructed by gathering methods of thebuiltins library and default methods such as “list”  
and “tuple”. For example, in figure 2, lineinputs=len(input) is excluded since “len” is a default  
method. For local relations, we parse import statements in the code to identify third-party methods  
that are included, and exclude them accordingly. A detailed illustration of this step can be found in  
Figure 11\.

Step 3: Graph organization. At this stage, we construct REPOGRAPHusing code lines as the  
fundamental building units. The graph can be represented asG={V,E}, whereVrepresents the  
set of nodes, with each node corresponding to a line of code, andErepresents the set of edges,  
capturing the relationships between these code lines. Each node inVcontains attributes to represent  
its meta-information, such aslinenumber,filename,directory, etc. Additionally, we  
classify each code line as either a “definition” (def) or a “reference” (ref) to a particular module.  
A “def” node corresponds to the line where a function, class, or variable is initially defined, while  
a “ref” node indicates a code line where this entity is referenced or invoked elsewhere in the code.  
Similar to soft links to “def” nodes, “ref” nodes also represent other variations of invoking methods.  
For example, in Figure 2, the class definition“class Model”would be a “def” node, while any  
subsequent usages of Model would be “ref” nodes. Each “def” node may have multiple “ref” nodes  
associated with it, as a single function or class can be referenced in various places throughout the  
code. We define two types of edges:EinvokeandEcontain. The triple(V 1 ,Econtain,V 2 )denotes  
thatV 1 (e.g., a function definition) contains another moduleV 2 (e.g., an internal function or class).  
The edgeEcontaintypically connects a “def” node to its internal components. In contrast,Einvoke  
represents an invocation relationship, usually connecting a “def” node to a “ref” node, where the  
reference node includes a dependency on the definition.

\#\#\#\# 3.2 UTILITY

The constructed REPOGRAPHserves as a structured representation of the current repository and  
facilitates better-related information collection and aggregation. For information collection based on  
REPOGRAPH, specifically, we use one search term each time for subgraph retrieval. Search terms are  
the key functions or classes that are determined by current states. For example, “separabilitymatrix”  
is the initial search term in Figure 2(c). We retrieve thek-hop ego-graphs (Hu et al., 2024\) with the  
search term in the centric. The ego-graph is crucial for solving the problem because it focuses  
on the immediate relationships (Jin et al., 2024\) around the search term, capturing the relevant  
dependencies and interactions within the repository, which is key to understanding the functional  
context. Additionally, the retrieved content explicitly contains information at both the method and  
line levels and implicitly expresses the grouping at the file level.

This process is abstracted viasearchrepograph()as illustrated in the middle of Figure 2\. The  
retrievedk-hop ego-graph will be flattened for further processing. We also tried other variants for  
integration later in Section 5.2 and their performance in Table 4\. We narrate how REPOGRAPH  
could be plugged in with existing representative research lines in the following.

Integration with procedural framework.In a procedural framework, LLMs are usually prompted  
in “localization” and “editing” stages with the given repository context and issue description. In this  
case, we usesearchrepograph()before both stages, leveraging our REPOGRAPHto assist in making  
more informed decisions at each step. For example, in Figure 2, we first include the subgraph of  
“separabilitymatrix”for localization, and then use the localized result“Model”to search in the  
edition stage. To implement the strategy, we flatten the context of retrieved ego-graphs and append  
it as part of the prompt. As a result, the LLM generation is conditioned on both retrieved ego-graphs  
and the context provided by baseline methods, helping the model preserve nuances.

Integration with agent framework.A significant difference in existing agent frameworks is the  
action space design, as expounded in Section 2\. To leverage the power of REPOGRAPH, we put  
searchrepograph()as an additional action in the action space. The agent decides when and where  
to use this action. The search term is also determined by the agent accordingly. The returned  
subgraph will be flattened and used as an observation for the next state.

\#\# 4 EXPERIMENTS

\#\#\#\# 4.1 SETUP

We evaluated REPOGRAPHas a plug-in component, i.e., integrated into existing baseline models of  
the two aforementioned research lines to assess its performance. We use the same baseline settings  
and configurations when incorporating REPOGRAPHto ensure a fair comparison.

Dataset.We test REPOGRAPHin SWE-bench-Lite^2. Each problem in the dataset requires submit-  
ting a patch to solve the underlying issue described in the input issue description. The goal is to  
generate a patch that accurately revises the relevant portions of the codebase within the repository,  
ensuring that all test scripts included in the dataset are successfully executed.

Baselines.We integrate REPOGRAPHwith representative methods from both aforementioned re-  
search lines. (i) For procedural frameworks, we evaluate the widely used traditional method,  
RAG (Lewis et al., 2020), as well as Agentless (Xia et al., 2024), an open-source state-of-the-art ap-  
proach in this direction. For RAG, we follow its initial setting and use BM25 for file-level retrieval.  
After that, we append the context of REPOGRAPHafter the code files as part of the prompt. Agent-  
less first performs a hierarchical localization in terms of “file-class/function-edits” and then conducts  
repair based on localization. The context of REPOGRAPHis inserted in every step of Agentless. (ii)  
For agent frameworks, we consider SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024\) and AutoCodeRover (Zhang  
et al., 2024). For both frameworks, we add an additional action “searchrepograph” for the LLM  
agent as described in Section 3\. All the choices in the two research lines incorporate GPT-4 and  
GPT-4o-based methods to ensure generalization. Detailed implementations and prompts used can  
be found in Appendix A.

Evaluation metrics.We evaluate all methods across two key dimensions: Accuracy and Average  
Cost. (i) For accuracy, we report theresolve rateandpatch application rate. The resolve rate rep-  
resents the percentage of issues successfully resolved across all data points. An issue is considered  
resolved if the submitted patch passes all test scripts. To assess the patch application rate, we attempt  
to apply the generated patches to the repository using thepatchprogram, counting only successful  
applications toward this metric. (ii) To evaluate cost efficiency, we report two metrics:average cost  
andaverage tokens, which refer to the inference cost and the number of input/output tokens used  
when querying the LLMs, respectively.

Configurations.We use the same GPT version as in the baselines in the experiments. We used GPT-  
4o(2024-05-13)and GPT-4-Turbo(gpt-4-1106-preview)from OpenAI for evaluation  
and analyses in our experiments. All evaluation processes are performed in a containerized Docker  
environment^3 , ensuring stability and reproducibility, made possible through contributions from the  
open-source community. Plug-ins with procedural frameworks usually take around 2 \- 3 hours to  
finish. For agent frameworks, the inference time is larger, up to around 10 hours.

\#\#\#\# 4.2 EXPERIMENT RESULTS

Table 2 presents the main evaluation results of all baseline methods and the correspond-  
ing performance with REPOGRAPH (+REPOGRAPH) as a plug-in in the SWE-bench-Lite test  
set. We also report the number of correct samples for each method. The performance in-  
crease is marked by↑num. We also tested other (open-source) LLMs using Claude-3.5-Sonnet  
(claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620)(Anthropic, 2024\) from Anthropic in Appendix C. Based  
on the results, we have the following key observations:

(i) REPOGRAPHbrings consistent performance gain for all combinations of frameworks and  
LLM model bases. Specifically, REPOGRAPHachieves an absolute improvement of+2. 66 and  
\+2. 34 in terms of the resolve rate for RAG and Agentless, respectively, which is 99 .63%and 8 .56%  
of relative improvement. The notable improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of our REPO-  
GRAPHin adapting to various scenarios by inducing relevant code context and performing precise  
code editings. Additionally, our best performance so far by plugging in Agentless, 29\. 67 , achieves  
thestate-of-the-artperformance on the benchmark^6 among all open-source methods.

(ii) Performance gain brought by REPOGRAPHis slightly larger on procedural frameworks  
than agent ones.With procedural frameworks, REPOGRAPHcorrectly fixes more issues than agent  
ones. This could be due to two primary reasons. Firstly, we observed that mature procedural frame-  
works tend to achieve better baseline performance than agent-based frameworks on SWE-bench.  
The initial definitive nature of procedural frameworks, with their well-defined running flow and  
structure, allows them to leverage plug-ins more effectively. Another reason is that this determinis-  
tic behavior reduces the complexity that arises from dynamic decision-making, a key characteristic  
of agent-based systems, thereby enabling a smoother integration of performance improvements.

(iii) Performance gain brought by REPOGRAPHdoes not rely on more costs.We also compute  
and report each method’s average cost and token consumption. By introducing REPOGRAPH, we  
manage to reduce the costs associated with managing the entire repository while achieving compa-  
rable or even superior performance. As shown in Table 2, the additional token cost introduced by  
RepoGraph is justified given the significant performance improvement it enables, particularly when  
compared to the substantially higher costs incurred by previous methods like SWE-agent. This  
indicates REPOGRAPH’s performance gains are not mainly due to increased token usage.

(iv) Average costs are generally larger on agent frameworks with REPOGRAPH. This phe-  
nomenon is especially obvious with SWE-agent, as it allows the agent to freely determine the next  
action based on the current observation. We also found that the integration with agent frameworks  
usually leads to larger cost increases, as exemplified by+0.13$and+0.18$with AutoCodeRover  
and SWE-agent, respectively. The reason lies in the large exploration space in agent frameworks.  
The agents might call thesearchrepograph()action many times, which leads to the explosion of

prompt contexts. We encourage users to be mindful of cost and to adopt a more granular approach  
to cost control when integrating REPOGRAPHinto the agent framework in the future.

\#\# 5 ANALYSIS

This section presents a detailed analysis to demonstrate that the additional context provided by  
REPOGRAPHis beneficial for the task. We begin by analyzing localization accuracy in comparison  
to the gold-standard patch. Next, we explore various REPOGRAPHconfigurations, focusing on how  
the additional context can be effectively integrated into the existing system. Finally, we perform  
an in-depth error analysis, highlighting aspects where REPOGRAPHcan be further improved. For  
more analyses including resolve rate in various aspects and action distributions of agent frameworks,  
please refer to Appendices C.

A crucial step in issue resolution is  
accurately identifying the correct  
locations within the code that re-  
quire modification. Proper local-  
ization is essential, as it forms the  
foundation for generating an ef-  
fective and accurate patch. With-  
out this step, the quality of the  
fix may be compromised, lead-  
ing to incomplete or incorrect so-  
lutions. We compute the per-  
centage of problems where the  
edit locations match the ground  
truth patch in three granularity.  
Namely, file-level, function-level,  
and line-level. We report that a  
patch contains the correct location if it edits asupersetof all locations in the ground truth patch.

Table 3 presents the results of our analysis. We observed that integrating REPOGRAPHwith all  
baseline methods significantly improves file-level accuracy, whereas the enhancement of accuracy  
in line-level is comparatively modest. This result aligns with our expectations, as file-level local-  
ization is the most coarse-grained, making it inherently easier to improve. In contrast, line-level  
localization, being the most fine-grained, poses a greater challenge due to its need for more precise  
identification of code segments. Additionally, we found that although line-level accuracy improve-  
ments are more pronounced for agent frameworks, their overall resolve rate is lower than that of  
procedural frameworks, as shown in Table 2\. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that  
localization, while necessary for generating a final patch, is insufficient. The success of the final  
revision still heavily relies on the underlying capabilities of LLMs. Agent frameworks, designed  
to operate in a trial-and-error fashion, are particularly susceptible to error accumulation. As these  
frameworks iteratively refine their patches, small inaccuracies in earlier localization steps can prop-  
agate and magnify throughout the process, ultimately reducing the overall resolve rate. Procedural  
frameworks, on the other hand, follow a more structured and deterministic approach to localization  
and patch generation. They typically localize and fix issues in a single, more direct step, which can  
help mitigate the compounding of errors.

\#\#\#\# 5.2 INVESTIGATION OFREPOGRAPHVARIANTS

In this section, we investigate the efficacy of various combinations of sub-graph retrieval and inte-  
gration techniques as outlined in Section 3\. We explore two sub-graph retrieval variants and two  
integration methods. Specifically, for sub-graph retrieval, we indexk-hop ego-graphs wherekis set  
to 1 and 2\. We limit our exploration tokvalues up to 2 due to the extensive context required for  
integration and the potential introduction of noise or irrelevant nodes fork≥ 3\. For the integration  
methods, we employ two distinct approaches: (i) directly flattening the textual sub-graph by explic-

Table 4: The number of nodes, edges, and tokens of REPOGRAPHand its variants. For different  
retrieval and integration variants, we report the average number on the test set. “summ.” refers to  
the summarized version by LLMs of the retrieved ego-graph.

itly detailing the relationships between the search term and its neighboring nodes, and (ii) leveraging  
an LLM first to summarize the sub-graph in terms of the core modules and salient dependencies, be-  
fore proceeding with further processing. Detailed implementations of these variants and prompts  
used can be found in Appendix B.1.

We begin by presenting some statistics for REPOGRAPHand its various configurations. Perfor-  
mance evaluations are conducted on Agentless with REPOGRAPHintegrated as a plug-in module.  
Table 4 reports the number of nodes and edges within the (sub)-graphs. Notably, the average number  
of nodes and edges for REPOGRAPHacross the SWE-bench dataset is quite substantial, featuring  
over 1,000 nodes and 25,000 edges. This highlights the comprehensive nature of the constructed  
structure. For the different variants, whenk= 1, the information within REPOGRAPHis concen-  
trated around the search term, resulting in an average of 11.6 nodes and 37.1 edges. Askincreases  
to 2, the retrieved ego-graph expands exponentially, reaching an average of 54\. 5 nodes and 89\. 9  
edges. Moreover, directly flattening the retrieved ego-graph often significantly increases the token  
count, frequently reaching several thousand tokens. However, utilizing an LLM as an additional  
summarizer greatly reduces the token count, typically around a thousand.

Table 4 presents the resolve rates for four variants of our method. Notably, while the 2 \-hop vari-  
ant incorporates additional information, directly flattening this information results in the poorest  
performance, with a resolve rate of 26 .00%, even lower than the original baseline. In contrast,  
incorporating summarization via the LLM significantly alleviates context length constraints and  
enhances information organization, thereby improving performance. For the 1 \-hop variant, how-  
ever, we observed that adding summarization actually degrades performance, reducing the resolving  
rate to 28 .33%. We hypothesize that this occurs because the flat 1 \-hop ego-graph already contains  
comprehensive information that fits within the LLM’s context window; thus, summarization may  
introduce inevitable information loss.

\`\`\`  
To demonstrate the representational power of  
REPOGRAPHfor repositories and its trans-  
ferability to tasks requiring an understand-  
ing of repository structures, we conducted  
experiments using the CrossCodeEval bench-  
mark (Ding et al., 2023). CrossCodeEval is a  
multilingual code completion benchmark that  
is derived from real-world repositories. It  
is designed to emphasize numerous cross-file  
dependencies. We focus on problems using  
Python as the evaluation programming lan-  
guage, leading to 2,665 samples. For evaluation metrics, we follow the settings in the original  
paper and measure performance with code match and identifier match metrics, assessing accuracy  
with exact match (EM), edit similarity (ES), and F1 scores. In our experiments, the search terms are  
determined to be the function within which the current line is to be completed.

Table 5 demonstrates the results on CrossCodeEval using GPT-4o and Deepseek-Coder as the back-  
bone language model. The original LLMs struggle with repository-level tasks, evidenced by an  
EM score of only 10\. 8 for code matching and 16\. 7 for identifier matching. These results indicate  
significant limitations in handling code structure and variable usage in a broader repository context.

Figure 3: Venn diagram of REPOGRAPHand baselines on (a) procedural framework and (b) agent  
framework on SWE-Bench-Lite. We also plot the error distribution of failing cases against counter-  
parts, e.g., detailed error distribution of 12 cases REPOGRAPHsucceeds while Agentless fails.

However, with the integration of the REPOGRAPHmethod, there is a substantial improvement across  
all metrics with both LLMs. Particularly, we find that the improvement brought by REPOGRAPHis  
more pronounced when integrated with GPT-4o. A potential reason is that GPT-4o is better at inter-  
preting the additional context information provided for better code reasoning. These improvements  
suggest that incorporating repository-level knowledge, as facilitated by REPOGRAPH, greatly en-  
hances the model’s ability to understand and generate more contextually accurate and semantically  
consistent code.

\#\#\#\# 5.4 ERRORANALYSIS

We want to compare REPOGRAPHwith the corresponding baselines to see the distribution of re-  
solved cases and analyze the error reasons for unresolved cases. We plot a Venn diagram for repre-  
sentative methods in both procedural and agent frameworks in Figure 3, respectively. We manually  
examined all the unique error cases and defined three error categories. (i) Incorrect localization  
refers to the failure in accurately identifying code snippets,(ii) contextual misalignmenthappens  
when the generated patch fails to align with the broader context of the codebase, and(iii) regressive  
fixintroduces new issues in resolving the original issues. More examples are in Appendix D.

We found that the improvement in agent frameworks is more complementary than procedural frame-  
works, with larger uniquely resolved cases of 22 compared with 12 in procedural frameworks. To-  
gether, they make even larger performance of 31 .33%and 22 .33%. The reason could also be at-  
tributed to the determinism of procedural frameworks. As a plug-in module, REPOGRAPHtends  
to make modifications on existing deterministic processes, resulting in larger overlaps in resolved  
issues compared with baselines. Agent frameworks, on the other hand, have quite different action  
distributions with REPOGRAPHas a plug-in (please refer to Appendix A.2). Therefore, the uniquely  
resolved cases are more compared with procedural frameworks. For error distributions, contextual  
misalignment is the most prevalent error type, followed by incorrect localization and regressive fixes  
for all methods, suggesting that while localization is often correct, the applied solutions may regress  
or fail to integrate contextually. The phenomenon also echoes the conclusion obtained in Section 5.1.  
This is intuitive as all the existing methods focus on providing a more comprehensive and desired  
context for LLMs to solve the task, which fundamentally depends on the power of backbone LLMs.  
We also found that when integrated with REPOGRAPH, the proportion of all three error types de-  
creases (specifically for “incorrect localization”), indicating that REPOGRAPHis specifically useful  
in aggregating the related contexts of the current to-be-fixed issue.

\#\# 6 CONCLUSION ANDDISCUSSION

This paper introduces REPOGRAPH, a plug-in module for modern AI software engineering. REPO-  
GRAPHoperates at the code-line level and offers desired navigation through code bases by incorpo-  
rating and aggregating information at the line level, file level, and repository level through subgraph  
retrieval of ego-graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world SWE tasks show that REPOGRAPH  
significantly boosts the performance of both procedural and agent frameworks. In addition, REPO-  
GRAPHis proved to be smoothly and effectively transferred to other tasks that require repository-  
level understanding. Future work could further investigate the generalizability of REPOGRAPH  
across different programming languages, frameworks, and developer environments. Real-time ex-  
ecution and feedback could also be explored to further enhance REPOGRAPHtowards a dynamic  
version for better AI software engineering abilities.

\#\# A Detailed implementations for each baseline method

This section details the implementation of all four methods in procedural and agent research lines  
mentioned in Section 4.1.

\#\#\# A.1 Procedural frameworks

Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the instructions we used for procedural frameworks, including local-  
ization and edition, respectively.

Figure 4: Instructions used in the procedural framework to localize to detailed files and code lines  
of edition.

We flattened the context of the retrieved ego-graph from REPOGRAPHinto the template of the  
instructions. Specifically, in both “localization” and “edition” stages, REPOGRAPHis flattened in  
the part ofFunction/ClassDependencies so that the LLMs could better understand its context.

\#\#\# A.2 Agent frameworks

We list all the instructions in every step of agent frameworks. The overall and system instruction is  
shown in Figure 6\.

The system instruction defines the task setting and the template for each response. We add  
“searchrepograph” as a new action for the agent to use in thecommanddocs, with its signature  
listed in Figure 7\.

We also plot the frequency for action invoked for both SWE-agent and SWE-agent with REPO-  
GRAPHin Figure 8\. We can see that with REPOGRAPH, the maximum turn of finishing the task is  
reduced from 38 to 35\. Also, we computed the average turn to finish the task, which demonstrates a  
similar trend of 21\. 47 to 19\. 12 , a significant improvement in efficiency while maintaining effective-  
ness. We also observe that the action “searchrepograph” is invoked mostly in the first 15 rounds of  
conversation with LLMs. It is more precise than the original action of “searchdir”, “searchfile”,  
and “findfile”.

\#\# B Detailed implementations for REPOGRAPH

\#\#\# B.1 REPOGRAPHvariant

In this section, we provide the implementations for variants of REPOGRAPHmentioned in Sec-  
tion 5.2.

In addition to directly flattening the retrieved ego-graph, we propose leveraging large language mod-  
els (LLMs) to first summarize the context. The full prompt, along with sample input and output, is  
provided in Figure 9\.

\#\#\# B.2 REPOGRAPHcomponents

We first provide a simplified version of Figure 2 in Figure 10, which helps readers quickly catch the  
overall pipeline of integration with REPOGRAPH.

We also provide an illustration in Figure 11 to explain in detail how we exclude project-independent  
dependencies mentioned in Section 3.1 Step 2\.

\#\# C Additional Results

\#\#\# C.1 Results on other LLMs

We conduct additional experiments on SWE-Bench-Lite with Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and the results are  
shown in Table 6\. We found that with Claude-3.5-Sonnet, the results of baselines are improved a  
little. This is intuitive as Claude-3.5-Sonnet is designed for better coding tasks. Additionally, inte-  
grating REPOGRAPHwith the baseline methods can still boost the performance by a large margin,  
which further prove the effectiveness and extendability of REPOGRAPHon different foundational  
models.

\#\#\# C.2 Results on localization for both pass and fail cases

In order to highlight the improvement in error localization and correction capability of REPOGRAPH,  
we provide a thorough analysis of both pass and fail cases. Results are shown in Table 7\. Interest-  
ingly, we found that the localization accuracy for failure cases is largely lower than the overall  
average results. This indicates that REPOGRAPHfixes the issues by correctly identifying the editing  
locations, without which the issue is unlikely to be resolved.

\`\`\`  
\#\#\# C.3 Resolve rate by repository

We plot the results of the resolve rate in terms of repository distribution in Figure 12\. From the fig-  
ure, it is clear that the resolution of issues varies significantly across different repositories. Notably,  
the Django and Sympy repositories have the most unresolved issues, with 75 and 61 unresolved  
issues, respectively. This may indicate a higher level of complexity in the issues or a larger backlog  
compared to the other repositories. On the other hand, Django has the highest number of resolved  
issues, with 39 cases. This highlights a strong effort to address issues, even though the unresolved  
count is still high. Sympy follows closely with 16 resolved issues, suggesting a similar trend. Other  
repositories like Scikit-learn, Sphinx, and Matplotlib have comparatively fewer issues overall, but  
their resolve rates are more balanced. For instance, Sphinx shows a ratio of 13 resolved to 3 unre-  
solved issues, reflecting a more consistent effort in issue resolution.

\#\#\# C.4 Resolve rate by time

We plot the results of the resolve rate in terms of the distribution of releasing time for repositories in  
Figure 13\. Most of the issues were observed in recent years, starting from 2018, with a substantial  
increase in the total number of issues identified after 2018\. In the early years (2012-2016), the  
number of issues remained relatively low, with both resolved and unresolved counts being minimal.  
Starting from 2017, there is a noticeable increase in unresolved issues, with 13 unresolved and only  
3 resolved issues. In 2019, the number of resolved and unresolved issues significantly increased,

with 19 resolved out of 59 issues. This trend continued to rise until 2020, where 47 issues remained  
unresolved, and only 17 were resolved, marking the year with the highest number of unresolved  
issues in the dataset. By 2021 and 2022, the number of unresolved issues slightly decreased, while  
the resolve rate increased compared to 2020\. This suggests an improvement in the system’s ability  
to address issues in these years. In 2023, although the total number of issues dropped to 30, the  
proportion of resolved issues remained strong, with 8 resolved out of 22 issues.

\#\# D Examples for error analyses

To help better understand the error category listed in Section 5.4, we provide one example for each  
category in Figure 14, Figure 15, and Figure 16\.

\#\# E Limitations and Future Work

(i) We only explored proprietary LLMs, i.e., GPT-4 series. Due to the poor performance of open-  
source models on this challenging task, we opted for proprietary models that have demonstrated  
superior results in code-related tasks. However, a comprehensive evaluation of open-source models  
such as Llama (Dubey et al., 2024\) could be a valuable direction for future work, particularly as  
these models continue to improve.

(ii) Experiments were only conducted on the Lite set due to the high cost of running large-scale  
experiments with proprietary models. Exploring more efficient model deployment strategies and  
alternative cost-effective options for running experiments on larger datasets will be essential for  
broader applicability.

(iii) Although REPOGRAPHcould be adapted to support other programming languages by adjusting  
the parsing schemes in the implementation, we only explored Python in our main experiments.  
Future work could extend this approach to other widely used programming languages, such as  
JavaScript, Java, or C++, to evaluate the generalizability of our methodology across different pro-  
gramming paradigms.

Correct expected format in invalid DurationFielderror message  
Description  
If you enter a duration “14:00” into a duration field, it translates to “00:14:00” which is 14 minutes.The current error message  
for invalid DurationFieldsays that this should be the format of durations: “\[DD\] \[HH:\[MM:\]\]ss\[.uuuuuu\]”. But according to the  
actual behaviour, it should be: “\[DD\] \[\[HH:\]MM:\]ss\[.uuuuuu\]”, because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and  
hours are optional if minutes are provided.This seems to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.  
Alsothe duration fields could have a default help\_textwith the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.

formatting for the “DurationField” used in Django models. REPOGRAPH, however, modifies  
django/forms/fields.py. This file handles Django form fields, not the model fields. While both model

(DurationField in init .py), not the form field.

There is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is "DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' ". This can be seen more  
clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before \`\\n\`):  
\>\>\> str(ds.groupby("letters"))  
"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'."  
While this isn't a problem in itself, itcauses an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code  
is correctly formattedand we also have docteststhat rely on DatasetGroupBytextual representation. Flake8 reports a violation  
on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctestsfail because the expected  
output doesn't match the actual output. Sowe have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable.  
Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctestwant the  
expected output to be exactly the sameas the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference.  
We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violationfor the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause  
other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunatelyit's not possible to just add \`\# NoQA\`  
comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and  
actual output from doctestpoint of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.  
Is there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupByrepresentation? Whouldit be OK to remove it? If so  
please let me know and I can make a pull request.

Figure 15: An example ofcontextual misalignment. The model-generated patch places the repr  
method in the wrong classDatasetGroupBy, whereas the correct patch modifies it in theGroupBy  
class. The repr method should be implemented in the GroupBy class because it deals with the  
general group-by functionality. “DatasetGroupBy” is a subclass and doesn’t require a new represen-  
tation method if “GroupBy” already has one. Additionally, when fixing white space trailing, while  
functionally similar, REPOGRAPH’s generation doesn’t exactly match the style or intention of the  
correct patch.

tion of REPOGRAPHnot only significantly improves Large Language Models (LLMs) in navigating  
and comprehending entire codebases, but also showcases the potential of integrating repository-wide  
structures into AI workflows. By extending the scope from function-level tasks to holistic repository  
management, REPOGRAPHpushes the boundaries of AI’s utility in modern software engineering.

expr.atoms() should return objects with no argsinstead of subclasses of Atom  
\`expr.atoms()\` with no arguments returns subclasses of \`Atom\` in \`expr\`. But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it  
has no \`.args\`.  
This should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance.

Figure 16: An example ofregressive fix. The model-generated patch successfully resolves the issue  
which requires the return of objects with no args instead of subclasses of Atom by adding the key  
code lineifnotexpr.args. However, the fix introduces other new issues such as the size of return  
objects, as exemplified in the unit tests.

This advancement opens new opportunities for using LLMs in complex engineering tasks such as  
automated debugging, repository maintenance, and large-scale refactoring. Furthermore, by high-  
lighting the importance of repository-level context for accurate code generation and maintenance,  
the paper sets a new trajectory for future research in AI and software engineering. It encourages  
deeper exploration of AI’s ability to not only write code but also understand and manage large-scale  
software projects more efficiently. We foresee minimal risks or negative societal impacts from this  
work. All datasets and benchmarks used in the evaluation are publicly available, and we adhered  
to their respective licenses. Additionally, REPOGRAPHhas been open-sourced, making it accessi-  
ble to the research community, particularly to groups with limited access to extensive computing  
resources, thus fostering broader adoption and further development.
